		<h3>Completing a Living Dex With Gens 1 and 2 (Pokémon Yellow)</h3>
		<p>A "living dex" is a fan designation for when a player completes the Pokédex and has one of each species in the PC or the party at the same time. 
		It's often considered to be much more difficult and time-consuming than a regular Pokédex because it often involves, for instance, playing the same game multiple 
		times to get multiple copies of a Legendary Pokémon.
		<br>
		With Gen 1, the Legendary Pokémon are not a concern, and with Gen 2, neither is breeding.</p>
		
		<p>The method by which you can get a completed Pokédex with Gen 2 on Yellow is described <a href="yellow-pokedex-gen2.html">here</a>. This page will focus more on requirements 
		specific to a living dex.</p>
		
		<h4>Version Exclusives</h4>
		<p>This is just to note that you will need to trade for multiple version-exclusives, instead of just one. You will need three Weedle, two Ekans, two Meowth, and two Koffing from your other games.
		<br>You will also need to trade a second Pikachu or Raichu from one of the other games, so that you can permanently keep a Raichu.</p>
		
		<h4>Mutually Exclusive Pokémon</h4>
		<p>The real issue with a Gen 1 only living dex lies in the mutually exclusive Pokémon. To have a living dex, you will need all of the following on your file:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Nine Starters (Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, Venusaur, Charmander, Charmeleon, Charizard, Squirtle, Wartortle, and Blastoise)</li>
			<li>Two Hitmons (Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan)</li>
			<li>Four Fossils (Omanyte, Omastar, Kabuto, and Kabutops</li>
			<li>Four Eeveelutions (Eevee, Flareon, Jolteon, and Vaporeon)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you have access to Pokémon Stadium, you can get all of these by defeating the Elite Four and Rival.</p>
		<p>Otherwise, to complete this living dex on Yellow alone, you will need <em>at minimum</em> <strong>two separate Gen 1 save files</strong> and <strong>one Gen 2 save file</strong>. Your process should look something like this:
		<ol>
			<li>Collect Fossil #1 and trade it to Gen 2.</li>
			<li>Collect all three Starters, trade them to Gen 2, breed them, and return them to Gen 1. Collect Fossil #2, trade it to Gen 2, breed both Fossils, and return them to Gen 1. Breed Eevee and a Hitmon in Gen 2 and return them.</li>
		</ol>
