		<h3>How Many Pokémon Can You Get with Only Pokémon Green (Japan) or Blue (International)?</h3>
		<p>
			Assuming you do not use any glitches, the answer is <strong>124.</strong> The Professor Oak challenge guide for (International) Blue can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gmp-piwpfUUyxnWULjQtB2m2lzWeYc-wwsXnnbyp_RY/edit">here</a>.</p>
			
			<p>The list of Pokémon you cannot get without trading, which equals 27 species, is as follows:
			<dl>
				<dt>Two Starters (6) - 6 total</dt>
				<dd>As you can only select one starter Pokémon, the other two starters, and their evolutions, are unavailable; this totals 6 Pokémon.</dd>
				
				<dt>Trade Evolutions (4) - 10 total</dt>
				<dd>Golem, Machamp, Alakazam, and Gengar evolve by trade. Without the ability to trade, they are unobtainable.</dd>
				
				<dt>Two Eeveelutions (2) - 12 total</dt>
				<dd>As you only receive one Eevee, you can only receive one of its evolutions.</dd>
				
				<dt>One Fossil (2) - 14 total</dt>
				<dd>As you can only obtain one Fossil in Mt. Moon, you miss out on the other Fossil Pokémon and its evolution.</dd>
				
				<dt>One Hitmon (1) - 15 total</dt>
				<dd>As you can only obtain one Hitmon, you miss out on the other.</dd>
				
				<dt>Version Exclusives (11) - 26 total</dt>
				<dd>The following Pokémon, and their evolutions, cannot be obtained without the use of glitches or trading: Ekans, Growlithe, Mankey, Oddish, Electabuzz, Scyther.</dd>
				
				<dt>Mythical/Event (1) - <strong>27</strong> total</dt>
				<dd>Outside of glitches, Mew was only obtainable via events that are no longer active. However, Mew was never needed to get the certificate from the Game Freak employee.</dd>
