		<h3>Completing the Pokédex With Gens 1 and 2 (Pokémon Yellow)</h3>
		<p>There are 151 Pokémon in Green/Blue's Pokédex. Only 150 are needed to get the certificate from the Game Freak employee in Celadon City. The game 
		is programmed to accept <em>any</em> 150, meaning if you use the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mew_glitch">Mew glitch</a> to 
		get Mew, you can skip another Pokémon. That said, this page focuses on getting the 150 Pokémon that aren't Mew.</p>
		
		<p>In order to complete the Pokédex in Pokémon Yellow with Gen 1 and 2 games you will need access to <strong><em>at minimum</em> a copy of Pokémon Red <em>and</em> a copy of Pokémon Green, <em>or</em> a copy of Pokémon Silver, <em>or</em> a copy of Pokémon Crystal.</strong><br> 
		Access to only Gold for Gen 2 is not sufficient, as Meowth and Persian are not available in Gold.</p>
		
		<h4>Version Exclusives</h4>
		<p>The following version-exclusive Pokémon have to be traded from another game:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Weedle, Kakuna, Beedrill (Red, Japanese Green/International Blue, Japanese Blue, Gold, Silver, or Crystal)</li>
			<li>Ekans, Arbok (Red, Gold, Silver, or Crystal)</li>
			<li>Meowth, Persian (Japanese Green/International Blue, Japanese Blue, Silver, or Crystal)</li>
			<li>Koffing, Weezing (Red, Japanese Green/International Blue, Japanese Blue, Gold, Silver, or Crystal)</li>
			<li>Jynx (Red, Japanese Green/International Blue, Japanese Blue, Gold, Silver, or Crystal)</li>
			<li>Electabuzz (Red, Gold, Silver, or Crystal)</li>
			<li>Magmar (Green, Gold, Silver, or Crystal)</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Mutually Exclusive Pokémon</h4>
		<p>Several Pokémon are mutually exclusive, meaning that if you get one species, you cannot get at least one other species. The list of mutually exclusive species is below.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Hitmons: Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan</li>
			<li>Fossils: Omanyte/Omastar, Kabuto/Kabutops</li>
			<li>Eeveelutions: Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you have access to Pokémon Stadium, you can get all of these by defeating the Elite Four and Rival.</p>
		<p>Otherwise, if you have access to <strong>Yellow and Gen 1 only</strong>, you would want to follow the steps listed on the <a href="yellow-pokedex.html">Yellow and Gen 1 page</a>.<br>
		If you have access to <strong>Yellow, Gen 1, and Gen 2</strong>, you can follow the following steps:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Pick a Fossil on one Gen 1 game.</li>
			<li>On the Gen 1 second game, pick the second Fossil.</li>
			<li>In Gen 2, breed the Eevee you get from Bill, and evolve the Tyrogue you get from Kiyo in Mt. Mortar and breed it. (Alternatively, you can also trade an Eeveelution or Hitmon from Gen 1 to Gen 2 to breed.)</li>
			<li>Trade the bred Pokémon back to the Gen 1 game(s) you want to complete the Pokédex on and evolve them at will. Trade the Fossils around before evolving them, or breed them in Gen 2.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>If you have access to <strong>Yellow and Gen 2</strong>, you can follow the following steps:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Pick a Fossil. Trade it to Gen 2.</li>
			<li>Restart the game and pick the second Fossil. Breed the first Fossil in Gen 2 and send it back, or just keep it unevolved and send it back. 
			Breed the Eevee and Tyrogue's evolution to get the other Eeveelutions and Hitmon into Yellow.</li>
		</ul>		
		
		<h4>Trade Evolutions</h4>
		<p>Four Pokémon evolve by trading: Machoke, Graveler, Kadabra, and Haunter. 
		You can get Machamp via in-game trade, meaning you will only need to trade for Golem, Haunter, and Alakazam. 
		The easiest way to get data for them is to trade them to another game and immediately trade the newly-evolved Pokémon back.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Raichu</h4>
		<p>You only get one Pikachu or Raichu in the game, and it is the Pikachu you start with. It will reject the Thunderstone, so you cannot get 
		a Raichu without trading. You can either trade for a Pikachu or Raichu from another version, or trade your starter Pikachu to another version, 
		evolve it there, and then trade it back. Note that if you do this, Pikachu will no longer follow you.</p>
