		<h3>How Many Pokémon Can You Get Without Evolving in Pokémon Blue?</h3>
		<p>The player can get up to 126 species total in Japanese Blue without trading. Without evolving any Pokémon, and only collecting evolutionary stages that the player can get in the wild / as a gift or purchase / as an in-game trade, the player can get up to <strong>103</strong> species.
			The Pokémon unavailable without evolving are as follows:</p>
			
			<dl>
				<dt>Starter Evolutions (2) - 2 total</dt>
				<dd>The starters are only available in their base forms, leaving the two evolutions inaccessible.</dd>
				<dt>Stone Evolutions (11) - 13 total</dt>
				<dd>While some stone evolutions can be found in Cerulean Cave, Nidoqueen, Nidoking, Vileplume, Arcanine, Poliwrath, Cloyster, Exeggutor, Starmie, Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon cannot.</dd>
				<dt>Fossils (2) - 15 total</dt>
				<dd>The Fossils can only be revived into their base forms, leaving Omastar and Kabutops unaccessible.</dd>
				<dt>Other (8) - 23 total</dt>
				<dd>Butterfree, Beedrill, Pidgeot, Persian, Golduck, Tentacruel, Gyarados, and Dragonite are unavailable without evolution.</dd>
			</dl>
			
			<p>In Blue, the player can receive a Golem and a Gengar via trade; they evolve after being traded to the player. Since the player is not responsible for initiating their evolution, 
			some may choose to consider these "acceptable" in a no-evo run - I would, since my personal philosophy is a little more like "Black/White 2 Habitat List" than strictly "no evolution". If they are counted, the number of species is <strong>101</strong>.</p>
