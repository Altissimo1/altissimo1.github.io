		<h3>How Many Pokémon Can You Get with Only Pokémon Yellow?</h3>
		<p>
			Assuming you do not use any glitches, the answer is <strong>129.</strong> The Professor Oak Challenge Guide for Yellow can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ffM1uUOhfVgxkQfhe41qPq1KHZ_ISAzxnJtHt23u9M/edit">here.</a></p>
			
			<p>The list of Pokémon you cannot get without trading, which equals 22 species, is as follows:
			<dl>
				<dt>Raichu (1) - 1 total</dt>
				<dd>You cannot evolve your starter Pikachu, and cannot get any other Pikachu, meaning Raichu is unobtainable without trading.</dd>
				
				<dt>Trade Evolutions (3) - 4 total</dt>
				<dd>Golem, Alakazam, and Gengar evolve by trade. Without the ability to trade, they are unobtainable. You can get Machamp via in-game trade.</dd>
				
				<dt>Two Eeveelutions (2) - 6 total</dt>
				<dd>As you only receive one Eevee, you can only receive one of its evolutions.</dd>
				
				<dt>One Fossil (2) - 8 total</dt>
				<dd>As you can only obtain one Fossil in Mt. Moon, you miss out on the other Fossil Pokémon and its evolution.</dd>
				
				<dt>One Hitmon (1) - 9 total</dt>
				<dd>As you can only obtain one Hitmon, you miss out on the other.</dd>
				
				<dt>Version Exclusives (12) - 21 total</dt>
				<dd>The following Pokémon, and their evolutions, cannot be obtained without the use of glitches or trading: Weedle, Ekans, Meowth, Koffing, Jynx, Electabuzz, Magmar.</dd>
				
				<dt>Mythical/Event (1) - <strong>22</strong> total</dt>
				<dd>Outside of glitches, Mew was only obtainable via events that are no longer active. However, Mew was never needed to get the certificate from the Game Freak employee.</dd>
