		<h3>Completing the Pokédex With Gens 1 and 2 (Pokémon Japanese Blue)</h3>
		<p>There are 151 Pokémon in Japanese Blue's Pokédex. Only 150 are needed to get the certificate from the Game Freak employee in Celadon City. The game 
		is programmed to accept <em>any</em> 150, meaning if you use the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mew_glitch">Mew glitch</a> to 
		get Mew, you can skip another Pokémon. That said, this page focuses on getting the 150 Pokémon that aren't Mew.</p>
		
		<p>In order to complete the Pokédex in Pokémon Blue with Gen 1 and 2 games you will need access to <strong><em>at minimum</em> one of the following sets of games:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Red and Green</li>
			<li>Red and Silver</li>
			<li>Green and Gold</li>
			<li>Gold and Silver</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Version Exclusives</h4>
		<p>The following version-exclusive Pokémon have to be traded from another game:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Ekans, Arbok (Red, Gold, Silver, or Crystal)</li>
			<li>Vulpix, Ninetales (Green, Yellow, or Silver)</li>
			<li>Mankey, Primeape (Red, Yellow, or Gold)</li>
			<li>Bellsprout, Weepinbell, Victreebel (Green, Yellow, Gold, Silver, and Crystal)</li>
			<li>Electabuzz (Red, Gold, Silver, or Crystal)</li>
			<li>Magmar (Green, Gold, Silver, or Crystal)</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Mutually Exclusive Pokémon</h4>
		<p>Several Pokémon are mutually exclusive, meaning that if you get one species, you cannot get at least one other species. The list of mutually exclusive species is below.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Starters: Bulbasaur/Ivysaur/Venusaur, Charmander/Charmeleon/Charizard, Squirtle/Wartortle/Blastoise</li>
			<li>Hitmons: Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan</li>
			<li>Fossils: Omanyte/Omastar, Kabuto/Kabutops</li>
			<li>Eeveelutions: Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you have access to <strong>Blue and Gen 1 only</strong>, you would want to follow the steps listed on the <a href="blue-pokedex.html">Blue and Gen 1 page</a>.<br>
		If you have access to <strong>Blue, Gen 1, and Gen 2</strong>, you can follow the following steps:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Pick a Starter and a Fossil on one Gen 1 game.</li>
			<li>On the second Gen 1 game, pick a second Starter. Trade it to Gen 2.</li>
			<li>If you have a third Gen 1 game, pick the third Starter, and trade it to Gen 2. If you don't, restart the second Gen 1 game, pick the third Starter, and trade it to Gen 2.</li>
			<li>In Gen 2, breed all three Starters, the Eevee you get from Bill, and evolve the Tyrogue you get from Kiyo in Mt. Mortar and breed it. (Alternatively, you can also trade an Eeveelution or Hitmon from Gen 1 to Gen 2 to breed.)</li>
			<li>Trade the bred Pokémon back to the Gen 1 game(s) you want to complete the Pokédex on and evolve them at will. Trade the Fossils around before evolving them, or breed them in Gen 2.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This process allows you a little more freedom with regards to what evolutionary stage you trade when. The second game's first playthrough also only needs to 
		get the Starter before you can trade, instead of going all the way to Celadon for the Eeveelution.</p>
		
		<p>If you have access to <strong>Blue and Gen 2 only</strong>, you can follow the following steps:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Pick a Starter and a Fossil. Trade them to Gen 2.</li>
			<li>Restart the game and pick a second Starter. Trade it to Gen 2.</li>
			<li>Restart the game and pick the third Starter and the second Fossil. Breed the Starters and first Fossil in Gen 2 and send them back, or just keep them unevolved and send them back. 
			Breed the Eevee and Tyrogue's evolution to get the other Eeveelutions and Hitmon into Blue.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Trade Evolutions</h4>
		<p>Four Pokémon evolve by trading: Machoke, Graveler, Kadabra, and Haunter. 
		You can get Gengar and Golem via in-game trade, meaning you will only need to trade for Machamp and Alakazam. 
		The easiest way to get data for them is to trade them to another game and immediately trade the newly-evolved Pokémon back.
