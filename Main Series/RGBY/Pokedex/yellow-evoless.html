		<h3>How Many Pokémon Can You Get Without Evolving in Pokémon Yellow?</h3>
		<p>The player can get up to 129 species total in Yellow without trading. Without evolving any Pokémon, and only collecting evolutionary stages that the player can get in the wild / as a gift or purchase / as an in-game trade, the player can get up to <strong>101</strong> species.
			The Pokémon unavailable without evolving are as follows:</p>
			
			<dl>
				<dt>Starter Evolutions (6) - 6 total</dt>
				<dd>The starters are only available in their base forms, leaving Ivysaur, Venusaur, Charmeleon, Charizard, Wartortle, and Blastoise inaccessible.</dd>
				<dt>Stone Evolutions (14) - 20 total</dt>
				<dd>While some stone evolutions can be found in Cerulean Cave, Nidoqueen, Nidoking, Clefable, Ninetales, Vileplume, Arcanine, Poliwrath, Victreebel, Cloyster, Exeggutor, Starmie, Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon cannot.</dd>
				<dt>Fossils (2) - 22 total</dt>
				<dd>The Fossils can only be revived into their base forms, leaving Omastar and Kabutops inaccessible.</dd>
				<dt>Other (6) - 28 total</dt>
				<dd>Butterfree, Pidgeot, Rapidash, Hypno, Gyarados, and Dragonite are unavailable without evolution.</dd>
			</dl>
			
			<p>In Yellow, the player can receive a Machamp via trade; they evolve after being traded to the player. Since the player is not responsible for initiating their evolution, 
			some may choose to consider Machamp "acceptable" in a no-evo run - I would, since my personal philosophy is a little more like "Black/White 2 Habitat List" than strictly "no evolution". If Machamp is counted, the number of species is <strong>102</strong>.</p>
