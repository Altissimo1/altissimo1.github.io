		<h3>Completing a Living Dex With Gen 1 (Pokémon Yellow)</h3>
		<p>A "living dex" is a fan designation for when a player completes the Pokédex and has one of each species in the PC or the party at the same time. 
		It's often considered to me much more difficult and time-consuming than a regular Pokédex because it often involves, for instance, playing the same game multiple 
		times to get multiple copies of a Legendary Pokémon.
		<br>
		With Gen 1, the Legendary Pokémon are not a concern, but getting multiple Starters is, due to the lack of breeding.</p>
		
		<p>The method by which you can get a completed Pokédex on Yellow is described <a href="yellow-pokedex.html">here</a>. This page will focus more on requirements 
		specific to a living dex.</p>
		
		<h4>Version Exclusives</h4>
		<p>This is just to note that you will need to trade for multiple version-exclusives, instead of just one. You will need three Weedle, two Ekans, two Meowth, and two Koffing from your copies of Red and Green/Blue.
		<br>Also, if you are playing an International version of Yellow, you will have to trade your only Jynx from either Red or Green/Blue to get Jynx. Therefore, if you are trying to simultaneously complete a living dex in Yellow and another Gen 1 game, be sure to "save" at least one Jynx so that both files can have a Jynx.
		<br>You will also need to trade a second Pikachu or Raichu from one of the other games, so that you can permanently keep a Raichu.</p>
		
		<h4>Mutually Exclusive Pokémon</h4>
		<p>The real issue with a Gen 1 only living dex lies in the mutually exclusive Pokémon. To have a living dex, you will need all of the following on your file:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Nine Starters (Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, Venusaur, Charmander, Charmeleon, Charizard, Squirtle, Wartortle, and Blastoise)</li>
			<li>Two Hitmons (Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan)</li>
			<li>Four Fossils (Omanyte, Omastar, Kabuto, and Kabutops</li>
			<li>Four Eeveelutions (Eevee, Flareon, Jolteon, and Vaporeon)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To complete this living dex on Yellow alone, you will need <em>at minimum</em> <strong>four separate save files</strong> for Gen 1 in order to get every Pokémon - at least three of which would need to be on Yellow. Your trade process should look something like this:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Get all three Starters in their base form, Fossil #1, and Eevee. Trade them to another game for holding.</li>
			<li>Get all three Starters and evolve them to their first forms. Collect Eeveelution #1 and Fossil #2, and trade them to another game for holding.</li>
			<li>Collect Fossil #1 and evolve it. Collect Eeveelution #2 and Hitmon #1, and trade them to another game for holding.</li>
			<li>Get all three Starters and evolve them to their final forms. Collect Fossil #2 and evolve it. Collect Eeveelution #3 and Hitmon #3. Trade back the rest of the starters, Eeveelutions, Hitmons, and Fossils from your holding game.</li>
		</ol>
