		<h3>Completing (Most of) The Pokédex With Gen 2 (Pokémon Silver)</h3>
		<p>There are 251 Pokémon in Silver's Pokédex. Only 249 are needed to get the certificate from the Game Freak employee in Celadon City. The game 
		is programmed to accept <em>any</em> 249, meaning if you use the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Celebi_Egg_glitch">Celebi egg glitch</a> to 
		get Mew or Celebi, or trade Celebi from a copy of Crystal that obtained it via the GS ball event, you can skip up to two other Pokémon.<br>
		However, not all 249 Pokémon that aren't Mew or Celebi are available in Gen 2 games without glitches or now-defunct events. In order to get all 249 Pokémon, trading with Red, Green, Blue, or Yellow is required. 
		This page focuses on getting as many Pokémon as possible <em>without</em> Gen 1 games, meaning only Gold, Silver, and Crystal.</p>
		
		<p>The maximum number of Pokémon you can get with only Gen 2 games is <strong>232</strong>, or <strong>233</strong> if you are able to access the GS Ball Celebi in Crystal.</p>
		
		<p>In order to complete the Pokédex in Pokémon Silver with only Gen 2 games you will need access to <strong><em>at minimum</em> a copy of Pokémon Gold.</strong> If you are able to get Celebi in Crystal, you 
		will need access to <strong><em>at minimum</em> a copy of Gold <em>and</em> Crystal.</strong><br>
		Access to only Crystal is not sufficient, as Mankey and Primeape are only available in Gold.</p>
		
		<h4>Version Exclusives</h4>
		<p>The following version-exclusive Pokémon have to be traded from another game:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Spinarak, Ariados (Gold, Crystal)</li>
			<li>Growlithe, Arcanine (Gold, Crystal)</li>
			<li>Mankey, Primeape (Gold)</li>
			<li>Gligar (Gold, Crystal)</li>
			<li>Teddiursa, Ursaring (Gold, Crystal) <em>(Note that in a Japanese or Korean copy of Silver, Phanpy and Teddiursa's availabilities are swapped)</em></li>
			<li>Mantine (Gold, Crystal)</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Mutually Exclusive Pokémon</h4>
		<p>Several Pokémon are mutually exclusive, meaning that if you get one species, you cannot get at least one other species. The list of mutually exclusive species is below.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Starters: Chikorita/Bayleef/Meganium, Cyndaquil/Quilava/Typhlosion, Totodile/Croconaw/Feraligatr</li>
			<li>Fire Stone Evolutions: Arcanine, Flareon, Ninetales <em>(As only one Fire Stone can be obtained without trading or Mystery Gift, only one Fire Stone evolution can be obtained)</em></li>
			<li>Water Stone Evolutions: Poliwrath, Vaporeon, Starmie, Cloyster <em>(As only one Water Stone can be obtained without trading or Mystery Gift, only one Water Stone evolution can be obtained)</em></li>
			<li>Leaf Stone Evolutions: Exeggutor, Victreebel, Vileplume <em>(As only one Leaf Stone can be obtained without trading or Mystery Gift, only one Leaf Stone evolution can be obtained)</em></li>
			<li>Thunderstone Evolutions: Raichu, Jolteon <em>(As only one Thunderstone can be obtained without trading or Mystery Gift, only one Thunderstone evolution can be obtained)</em></li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you have access to Crystal or Mystery Gift, you can get infinite evolutionary stones via those methods.</p>
		<p>Otherwise, you will need multiple files.</p>
		<p>If you have access to 2 other games, then each game can pick a different Starter, and you can trade around to get them all in your Pokédex. If you have access to 3 other games, then each game can also pick a different 
		Water Stone evolution.<br>
		However, if you only have access to 2 games total (Gold and Silver), you would need to do the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Pick a Starter on one game, play until you reach Bill's grandfather, and choose an evolution for each of the four stone evolutions. For Fire Stone, choose whichever of Growlithe or Vulpix is obtainable in your game.</li>
			<li>On the second game, pick a different Starter, play until Bill's grandfather, and choose a different evolution for the stone evolutions.</li>
			<li>Trade the second game's Starter and stone evolutions to the first game.</li>
			<li>Start a new file on the second game, pick the third Starter, and choose the remaining Fire Stone evolution and a new Water Stone evolution.</li>
			<li>Trade the game's Starter and stone evolutions to the first game.</li>
			<li>Start a new file on the second game, pick any Starter, and choose the remaining Water Stone evolution.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Now you will have all three starters and all but one stone Pokémon on your first file, and the last Water Stone evolution on the second. At this point, trade back and forth 
		until the game you're trying to complete the Pokédex on has data for each Starter and stone Pokémon.<br>
		You will need to breed your Starters, or keep them unevolved, in order to register data for all stages.</p>
		
		<p>If you have access to Crystal, you can do the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Start new files in Gold, Silver, and Crystal. Pick a different Starter in each game.</li>
			<li>For stone evolutions, collect evolutionary stones in Crystal and use them to evolve Pokémon, or trade them to other games.</li>
			<p>Now you will have one starter on each file. At this point, trade back and forth 
			until the game you're trying to complete the Pokédex on has data for each Starter and stone Pokémon.<br>
			You will need to breed your Starters, or keep them unevolved, in order to register data for all stages.</p>
		</ul>
		
		<p>If you have access to Mystery Gift (but not Crystal), you can do the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Pick a Starter on one game. Optionally, play until you reach Bill's grandfather, and choose an evolution for each of the four stone evolutions. For Fire Stone, choose whichever of Growlithe or Vulpix is obtainable in your game.</li>
			<li>On the second game, pick a different Starter. Optionally, play until Bill's grandfather, and choose a different evolution for the stone evolutions.</li>
			<li>Trade the second game's Starter and stone evolutions (if you received them) to the first game.</li>
			<li>Start a new file on the second game and pick the third Starter. Optionally, choose the remaining Fire Stone evolution and a new Water Stone evolution.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Now you will have 2 starters on your first file and one on your second, plus perhaps some stone evolutions. At this point, trade back and forth 
		until the game you're trying to complete the Pokédex on has data for each Starter and any stone evolutions you received.<br>
		You will need to breed your Starters, or keep them unevolved, in order to register data for all stages.<br>
		After using as many stones as you had access to, use Mystery Gift to collect further stones and use them to evolve the remaining Pokémon.</p>
		
		<p>If you have access to Red, Green, Blue, or Yellow, you would not need to worry about any of the stone scarcity problems as those games can buy infinite stones.</p>		
		
		<h4>Trade Evolutions</h4>
		<p>Ten Pokémon evolve by trading: Golem, Machamp, Alakazam, Gengar, Politoed, Slowking, Steelix, Scizor, Kingdra, and Porygon2. The easiest way to get data for them is to trade them to another game and immediately trade 
		the newly-evolved Pokémon back.<br>
		You will need two King's Rocks, two Metal Coats, one Dragon Scale, and one Upgrade to evolve Politoed, Slowking, Steelix, Scizor, Kingdra, and Porygon2. The following list contains locations for each.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Metal Coat: S.S. Aqua, and in Crystal, held by a Magneton you receive in a trade. Can also be held by wild Magnemite, allowing for an infinite supply of Metal Coats.</li>
			<li>King's Rock: Slowpoke Well, and in Crystal, held by Cooltrainer Gaven's Kingler in his second rematch. Can also be held by wild Slowpoke and Poliwhirl, allowing for an infinite supply of King's Rocks.</li>
			<li>Dragon Scale: Mt. Mortar. Can also be held by wild Horsea, Seadra, Dratini, and Dragonair, allowing for an infinite supply of Dragon Scales.</li>
			<li>Upgrade: Silph Co. There is only one, so after using it to evolve Porygon, you cannot get any more without restarting.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Missing Pokémon</h4>
		<p>The following list contains all Pokémon that you cannot get without access to a Gen 1 game, or glitches.</p>
