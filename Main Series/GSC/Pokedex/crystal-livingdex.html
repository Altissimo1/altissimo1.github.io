		<h3>Completing (Most of) a Living Dex With Gen 2 (Pokémon Crystal)</h3>
		<p>A "living dex" is a fan designation for when a player completes the Pokédex and has one of each species in the PC or the party at the same time. It's often considered to be much more difficult and time-consuming than a regular Pokédex because it often involves, for instance, playing the same game multiple times to get multiple copies of a Legendary Pokémon.<br>
		With Gen 2, the Legendary Pokémon are, fortunately, not a concern. However, the limited availability of evolutionary stones may be a concern.</p>
		<p>The method by which you can get a mostly-completed Pokédex (minus missing Gen 1 Pokémon) on Crystal is described <a href="crystal-pokedex.html">here</a>. This page will focus more on requirements specific to a living dex.</p>
		
		<p>Because Gen 2 lacks version-exclusive legendaries and generally lacks mutually exclusive Pokémon period, and because of the introduction of breeding, completing a living dex in Gen 2 actually requires comparatively 
		little effort. You will need access to <em>at minimum</em> <strong>three separate save files</strong> in order to obtain all Starters, but unlike later games with version-exclusive legendaries, you can trade 
		these starters as soon as trading is available, instead of having to play through to (usually) the end of the game to get the missing Pokémon.</p>
		
		<h4>Celebi</h4>
		<p>This is just to note that if you have access to a GS Ball Celebi, keep in mind that Gold and Silver cannot obtain it. If you wanted to, for instance, complete a living dex of Gold or Silver and Crystal simultaneously, 
		you would need to get multiple Celebi in Crystal, requiring multiple save files that will each need to defeat the Elite Four.</p>
