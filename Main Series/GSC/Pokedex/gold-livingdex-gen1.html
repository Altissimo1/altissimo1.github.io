		<h3>Completing a Living Dex With Gens 1 and 2 (Pokémon Gold)</h3>
		<p>A "living dex" is a fan designation for when a player completes the Pokédex and has one of each species in the PC or the party at the same time. It's often considered to be much more difficult and time-consuming than a regular Pokédex because it often involves, for instance, playing the same game multiple times to get multiple copies of a Legendary Pokémon.<br>
		With Gen 2, the Legendary Pokémon are, fortunately, not a concern, and with Gen 1, neither is the lack of evolutionary stones.</p>
		<p>The method by which you can get a completed Pokédex with Gen 1 on Gold is described <a href="gold-pokedex-gen1.html">here</a>. This page will focus more on requirements specific to a living dex.</p>
		
		<p>Because Gen 2 lacks version-exclusive legendaries and generally lacks mutually exclusive Pokémon period, and because of the introduction of breeding, completing a living dex in Gen 2 actually requires comparatively 
		little effort. You will need access to <em>at minimum</em> <strong>three separate Gen 2 save files</strong>, on two different copies, and <strong>three Gen 1 save files</strong> <em>or</em>, with access to Yellow, <strong>two Gen 1 save files</strong>. Your process should look something like this:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Collect Johto Starter #1 and trade it to the second Gen 2 game.</li>
			<li>Collect Johto Starter #2 and trade it to the second Gen 2 game.</li>
			<li>Collect Johto Starter #3. Trade the other starters back to the first Gen 2 game and breed them to complete the living dex.</li>
			<li>Start a Gen 1 save file. If it is not Yellow, collect Kanto Starter #1 and Fossil #1; if you are playing Yellow, collect all three starters and Fossil #1. Trade them to Gen 2.</li>
			<li>Collect Kanto Starter #2 (if not playing Yellow) and Fossil #2 and trade them to Gen 2.</li>
			<li>If not playing Yellow, collect Kanto Starter #3 and trade it to Gen 2.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>If you have access to Pokémon Stadium, however, you can get all of these by defeating the Elite Four and the Rival and then trade them.</p>
		
		<h4>Celebi</h4>
		<p>This is just to note that if you have access to a GS Ball Celebi with Crystal, you can obviously trade it to Gold to add it to Gold's living dex. However, if you wanted to, for instance, complete a living dex of Gold and Crystal simultaneously, 
		you would need to get multiple Celebi in Crystal, requiring multiple save files that will each need to defeat the Elite Four.</p>
