		<h3>Completing (Most of) The Pokédex With Gen 2 (Pokémon Crystal)</h3>
		<p>There are 251 Pokémon in Crystal's Pokédex. Only 249 are needed to get the certificate from the Game Freak employee in Celadon City. The game 
		is programmed to accept <em>any</em> 249, meaning if you use the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Celebi_Egg_glitch">Celebi egg glitch</a> to 
		get Mew or Celebi, or have access to the GS Ball Celebi in your copy of Crystal, you can skip up to two other Pokémon.<br>
		However, not all 249 Pokémon that aren't Mew or Celebi are available in Gen 2 games without glitches or now-defunct events. In order to get all 249 Pokémon, trading with Red, Green, Blue, or Yellow is required. 
		This page focuses on getting as many Pokémon as possible <em>without</em> Gen 1 games, meaning only Gold, Silver, and Crystal.</p>
		
		<p>The maximum number of Pokémon you can get with only Gen 2 games is <strong>232</strong>, or <strong>233</strong> if you are able to access the GS Ball Celebi.</p>
		
		<p>In order to complete the Pokédex in Pokémon Crystal with only Gen 2 games you will need access to <strong><em>at minimum</em> a copy of Pokémon Gold <em>and</em> a copy of Silver.</strong><br>
		Access to only Gold is not sufficient, as Mankey and Primeape are only available in Gold, while Vulpix and Ninetales are only available in Silver.</p>
		
		<h4>Version Exclusives</h4>
		<p>The following version-exclusive Pokémon have to be traded from another game:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Mareep, Flaaffy, Ampharos (Gold, Silver)</li>
			<li>Vulpix, Ninetales (Silver)</li>
			<li>Mankey, Primeape (Gold)</li>
			<li>Girafarig (Gold, Silver)</li>
			<li>Remoraid, Octillery (Gold, Silver)</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Mutually Exclusive Pokémon</h4>
		<p>Some Pokémon are mutually exclusive, meaning that if you get one species, you cannot get at least one other species. The list of mutually exclusive species is below.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Starters: Chikorita/Bayleef/Meganium, Cyndaquil/Quilava/Typhlosion, Totodile/Croconaw/Feraligatr</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You will need access to two games anyway to finish the Pokédex. So, you can have each game choose a different Starter, and then trade around & breed it to get all the Starters registered.</p>
		
		<h4>Trade Evolutions</h4>
		<p>Ten Pokémon evolve by trading: Golem, Machamp, Alakazam, Gengar, Politoed, Slowking, Steelix, Scizor, Kingdra, and Porygon2. The easiest way to get data for them is to trade them to another game and immediately trade 
		the newly-evolved Pokémon back.<br>
		You will need two King's Rocks, two Metal Coats, one Dragon Scale, and one Upgrade to evolve Politoed, Slowking, Steelix, Scizor, Kingdra, and Porygon2. The following list contains locations for each.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Metal Coat: S.S. Aqua, and held by a Magneton you receive in a trade. Can also be held by wild Magnemite, allowing for an infinite supply of Metal Coats.</li>
			<li>King's Rock: Slowpoke Well, and held by Cooltrainer Gaven's Kingler in his second rematch. Can also be held by wild Slowpoke and Poliwhirl, allowing for an infinite supply of King's Rocks.</li>
			<li>Dragon Scale: Mt. Mortar. Can also be held by wild Horsea, Seadra, Dratini, and Dragonair, allowing for an infinite supply of Dragon Scales.</li>
			<li>Upgrade: Silph Co. There is only one, so after using it to evolve Porygon, you cannot get any more without restarting.</li>
		</ul>
