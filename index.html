      <p>I have data dumps and prose about things I find interesting regarding Pokémon games.</p>
      <p>I also compile links to resources elsewhere that I find useful. <a href="Maintenance/resources.html">Here</a> are some generalized resources. More specific resources are linked on more specific pages.</p>
	  
	  <h3><u>Pokopia</u></h3>
	  <p>The next Pokémon spin-off game, Pokopia, is releasing on 5 March. My last attempt to document a game (Z-A) during its immediate release did not go well, so I will not be trying to document it immediately. Odds are I will not try another documentation of a newly released (new) game until I am sufficiently "caught up" with all the older games I'm trying to get through documenting.</p>
	  
	  <h3><u>FireRed and LeafGreen Rereleases</u></h3>
	  <p>On 27 Feb, FireRed and LeafGreen were re-released for Nintendo Switch, with support for local multiplayer only. Although the games have been confirmed to be able to "transfer" Pokémon to HOME in the future, this functionality has not yet been implemented.</p>
	  <p>If there is a FireRed/LeafGreen resource you want to see referenced or want to see me make, or if you find any problems with my existing information, please <a href="Maintenance/contact.html">let me know</a> or consider submitting a PR or starting an Issue on GitHub.</p>
	  <p>It has been confirmed that the Auroraticket and Mysticticket are both available in these re-releases. I have updated my coverage accordingly to reference them. My locations, Pokédex, and min/max level pages are a little inconsistent in their treatment of re-releases, so I intend to fix them up in the coming weeks.</p>
	  
      <h3><u>Current Projects</u></h3>
      <p><em>last updated 20 Feb 2026</em></p>
