		<h2>Resource Compilation Page></h2>
		<p>Check out <a href="https://altissimo1.github.io/resources.html">Resources</a> for a compilation of some of the best resources I know of for Pokémon stuff.</p>
		
		<h2>My Own Creations</h2>
		<p>This site is also home to a number of my own personal resources created for my own benefit and/or for other Pokémon communities.</p>
		<h3>Pokémon: Legends Arceus</h3>
		<h4><a href="Pokemon Locations/Main.html">Locations Maps</a></h4>
    		<h4><a href="Wisp Locations/Wisps.html">Wisps Maps</a></h4>
		
		<h3>Main Series Pokémon</h3>
		<p>Currently, I'm working on creating pages for each area with encounter tables, item info, and Trainer info, as well as several plaintext pages with supplementary info. Right now, I only have one test page as I work out the kinks in my script and JSON files.</p>
		<h4><a href="Main Series/RGBY/index.html">RGBY</a></h4>
		
		<p>Coming at some point: Pages for Pokémon Pinball.</p>
