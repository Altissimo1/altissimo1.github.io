	<p><strong>Regarding Alphas:</strong> Most of the spawn points (each of which is represented by a singular icon object on the map) have the chance to spawn Alpha Pokémon. I have not provided the chance of each Alpha Pokémon as it was largely irrelevant to the original purpose of the guide. However, for each Pokémon that can appear at a spawn point, you can assume that there is between roughly a 0.50% - 2.00% chance for that encounter slot to give you an Alpha Pokémon. This number varies depending on how many Pokémon are in the spawn point (a spawn point that only has 1 Pokémon choice is likely to be a higher value), and the relative rarities of each Pokémon (a spawn point with 2 choices will generally have a higher Alpha probability for the more common Pokémon). Note however that the 0.50% - 2.00% chance I stated is part of the chance of the overall spawn point, not the specific Pokémon species' rate. Therefore, if a spawn point has a 5% chance of spawning a specific species, then what that actually means is that it might have a 4.5% chance of spawning the regular Pokémon and a 0.5% chance of spawning an Alpha of that Pokémon. <br />
	If you don't see the Alpha icon in the box on the right when you click a spawn point, in the Levels column, this means that spot has no chance to spawn any Alphas of that species.<br />
	If there is sufficient demand for alpha spawn rates to be displayed independently, I may add them, but it is a time-consuming prospect. Let me know if you want to see it (see <a href="https://altissimo1.github.io/resources.html">Resources</a> for contact info).<br />
