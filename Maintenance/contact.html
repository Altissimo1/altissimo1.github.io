      <h2>Contact Me</h2>
      <p>If you notice errors, have suggestions as to things I can include here, have questions, want to contribute pages or translations, etc. - I encourage you to contact me. My email is altissimo783 AT gmail DOT com. If you know me on Discord, you can message me there too, but as a general rule I don't accept friend requests from people I don't know or don't share a server with.</p>
	  <p>Seeing as this is an open-source <a href="https://github.com/Altissimo1/altissimo1.github.io">GitHub project</a>, you can also submit pull requests or contact me on GitHub if you prefer. I'll accept pull requests for things like: fixing errors or changing wording to be more clear; adding a page with a new resource; adding a link to a new resource; adding an entire new resource to the project itself.</p>
