      <h2>About</h2>
      <h3><u>About Me</u></h3>
      <p>I like Pokémon. Possibly an unhealthy amount. I'm also frustrated that it can be difficult to find good sources for some Pokémon info sometimes. I hope to be able to compile accurate data and good resources here.</p>
      <h3><u>About This Site</u></h3>
      <p>It's very minimalist. It's mostly a place to dump data that I have curated, and that doesn't really lend itself to any sort of fancy layout. It certainly doesn't lend itself easily to mobile device display, so by and large I haven't taken mobile development into account at all when creating pages. I would rather just pay someone else for mobile development if it comes to it, and being able to afford to pay someone is one of the goals I outline on my Support page.</p>
      <p>Frequently asked questions will go here too when questions begin to be asked.</p>
