	  <h2>Support the Site</h2>
      <p>If you are interested in supporting my work or contributing to this site in some capacity, here are some things I'd be interested in.</p>
      <h3><u>Monetary</u></h3>
      <p>I am one person and I work on this as a labor of love. I don't intend to ever have ads on here, nor do I intend to gate any of my content behind a paywall. That said, if you like the work I'm doing and want to support me, please consider a donation.</p>
      <p><a href="https://ko-fi.com/altissimo1">Ko-Fi</a></p>
      <p>If a sufficient number/amount of donations are received, I want to use the money for some or all of the following (in no particular order):</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Pay someone to assist with developing for mobile devices</li>
         <li>Pay someone to assist with improving the look and accessibility of the site</li>
         <li>Pay people to assist with writing and preparing my planned content, improving the speed at which I can make updates</li>
         <li>Pay people who know more than I do about some games to help with content there, allowing me to spend less time on it myself</li>
         <li>Pay people to make translations of pages</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><u>Content</u></h3>
      <p>Do you have a web tool that you've developed? Do you have a Google Docs guide to something Pok√©mon-related, that doesn't have a permanent home? Do you have an article or interesting bit of prose you'd like to post somewhere? If so, get in touch or submit a pull request - this is the kind of thing I want to be able to host on the site on behalf of others.</p>
      <p>As an existing example, the Mystery Dungeon Wonder Mail generator was a tool developed by the speedrunning community that was originally distributed as a local file you could run to open in your browser. I offered instead to post it on my website to give it some more exposure and a more permanent home, and the developers agreed. If you've been working on something and want to share it with the world, definitely contact me or submit a pull request and we can discuss putting it up here.</p>
      <h3><u>Translations</u></h3>
      <p>I'd like for the content here to reach more than just an English-speaking audience, but English is the only language I speak. If you'd like to see this site in your native language, contact me and we can discuss it - I'm willing to pay you for your time as a translator, if you're willing to be one.</p>
