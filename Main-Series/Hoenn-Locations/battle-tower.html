      <p>The Battle Tower is a Battle facility where the goal is to defeat Trainers without losing. Winning a certain number of battles in the row can give the player rewards, which are described below.</p>
      <p>The following restrictions and rules apply to battles conducted in the Battle Tower:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>The player will not receive money, and their Pokémon will not receive experience. Instead, the player will receive a prize after each round of 7 battles completed. The list of items that can be received is shown below.</li>
         <li>The player cannot enter two Pokémon of the same species, or holding the same held item. Opposing Trainers will never use two Pokémon of the same species, or holding the same held item.</li>
         <li>The player's Pokémon will be automatically healed after every battle.</li>
         <li>Items used or swapped (via Trick, Thief, Knock Off, or Covet) during the battle will be given back to the Pokémon after the battle.</li>
         <li>Battles are conducted in rounds of 7.</li>
         <li>Set Mode is enforced.</li>
         <li>In Level 50 mode, Pokémon higher than level 50 cannot be entered.</li>
         <li>The moves Return and Frustration, when used by the opponent, will always have their maximum power.</li>
         <li>Losing a battle will reset the player's streak to 0. Turning off the game mid-battle, or mid-round without saving, will count as a loss and reset the streak.</li>
         <li>Pokémon encountered in battles will not be added to the Pokédex.</li>
         <li>All opposing Trainers will use Pokémon that can be found in the Hoenn Pokédex. The player, however, can use any Pokémon in the National Pokédex, except for those shown in the table below.</li>
         <li>All battles are Single Battles.</li>
         <li>Enemy Pokémon will always take their Nature, Item, moves, and EVs from predetermined 'sets'.</li>
         <li>Enemy Pokémon that can have two Abilities will always have a random Ability. Enemy Pokémon that can be male or female will have their gender randomly determined.</li>
         <li>Soul Dew will have no effect if entered.</li>
         <li>Some Pokémon cannot be entered altogether, and will never be encountered on an opponent's team:</li>
      </ul>
