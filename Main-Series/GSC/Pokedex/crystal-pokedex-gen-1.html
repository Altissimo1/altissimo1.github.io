      <h2>Completing the Pokédex With Gens 1 and 2 (Pokémon Crystal)</h2>
      <p>There are 251 Pokémon in Crystal's Pokédex. Only 249 are needed to get the certificate from the Game Freak employee in Celadon City. The game 
         is programmed to accept <em>any</em> 249, meaning if you use the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mew_glitch">Mew glitch</a> or <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Celebi_Egg_glitch">Celebi egg glitch</a> to 
         get Mew or Celebi, or have access to the GS Ball Celebi in your copy of Crystal, you can skip up to two other Pokémon. This page focuses on getting the 249 Pokémon that aren't Mew and Celebi.
      </p>
      <p>In order to complete the Pokédex in Pokémon Crystal, you will need access to <em>at minimum</em> one of the following combinations:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>A copy of Pokémon Gold and a copy of Pokémon (Japanese) Green / (International) Blue or Yellow, or</li>
		<li>A copy of Pokémon Silver and a copy of Pokémon Red or Yellow</li>
	  </ul>
      <h3><u>Version Exclusives</u></h3>
      <p>The following version-exclusive Pokémon have to be traded from another game:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Mareep, Flaaffy, Ampharos (Gold or Silver)</li>
         <li>Vulpix, Ninetales (JP Green/INT Blue, Yellow, or Silver)</li>
         <li>Mankey, Primeape (Red, Yellow, or Gold)</li>
         <li>Girafarig (Gold or Silver)</li>
         <li>Remoraid or Octillery (Gold or Silver)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><u>Mutually Exclusive Pokémon</u></h3>
      <p>Several Pokémon are mutually exclusive, meaning that if you get one species, you cannot get at least one other species. The list of mutually exclusive species is below.</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Chikorita/Bayleef/Meganium, Cyndaquil/Quilava/Typhlosion, Totodile/Croconaw/Feraligatr</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In order to get all three starters, you will need access to <em>at minimum</em> three separate save files of Gold, Silver, or Crystal, where each save file picks a different starter.</p>
      <p>Within Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow, some Pokémon are further mutually exclusive:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Bulbasaur/Ivysaur/Venusaur, Charmander/Charmeleon/Charizard, Squirtle/Wartortle/Blastoise <em>(except with Yellow or Pokémon Stadium)</em></li>
		<li>Omanyte/Omastar, Kabuto/Kabutops <em>(except with Pokémon Stadium)</em></li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>If you have access to Pokémon Stadium, beating the Elite Four and Rival will reward you with a random Pokémon that can include the starters or Fossil Pokémon. These Pokémon can be traded first to a copy of Red, Green, Blue, or Yellow and then to Gold, Silver, or Crystal.</li>
	  <p>If you cannot access Pokémon Stadium, in order to get both Fossils, you will need access to <em>at minimum</em> two separate save files of Red, Green, Blue, or Yellow, where each file picks a different Fossil. If you do not have access to Yellow, you will need three files instead.</li>
	  <h3><u>Trade Evolutions</u></h3>
      <p>Ten Pokémon evolve by trading: Golem, Machamp, Alakazam, Gengar, Politoed, Slowking, Steelix, Scizor, Kingdra, and Porygon2. The easiest way to get data for them is to trade them to another game and immediately trade the newly-evolved Pokémon back.</p>
      <p>You will need two King's Rocks, two Metal Coats, one Dragon Scale, and one Up-Grade to evolve Politoed, Slowking, Steelix, Scizor, Kingdra, and Porygon2. Note that these cannot be obtained by trading with Red, Green, Blue, or Yellow.</p>
