      <h2>Completing the Pokédex With Gens 1 and 2 (Pokémon Red)</h2>
      <p>There are 151 Pokémon in Red's Pokédex. Only 150 are needed to get the certificate from the Game Freak employee in Celadon City. The game 
         is programmed to accept <em>any</em> 150, meaning if you use the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mew_glitch">Mew glitch</a> to 
         get Mew, you can skip another Pokémon. This page focuses on getting the 150 Pokémon that aren't Mew.
      </p>
      <p>In order to complete the Pokédex in Pokémon Red with Gen 1 and Gen 2 games, you will need access to <em>at minimum</em> one of the following combinations:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>A copy of Pokémon Japanese Green/International Blue, or</li>
         <li>A copy of Pokémon Silver</li>
      </ol>
      <h3><u>Version Exclusives</u></h3>
      <p>The following version-exclusive Pokémon have to be traded from another game:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Sandshrew, Sandslash (Japanese Green/International Blue, Japanese Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, or Crystal)</li>
         <li>Vulpix, Ninetales (Japanese Green/International Blue, Yellow, or Silver)</li>
         <li>Meowth, Persian (Japanese Green/International Blue, Japanese Blue, Silver, or Crystal)</li>
         <li>Bellsprout, Weepinbell, Victreebel (Japanese Green/International Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, or Crystal)</li>
         <li>Magmar (Japanese Green/International Blue, Gold, Silver, or Crystal)</li>
         <li>Pinsir (Japanese Green/International Blue, Japanese Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, or Crystal)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><u>Mutually Exclusive Pokémon</u></h3>
      <p>Several Pokémon are mutually exclusive, meaning that if you get one species, you cannot get at least one other species. The list of mutually exclusive species is below.</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Bulbasaur/Ivysaur/Venusaur, Charmander/Charmeleon/Charizard, Squirtle/Wartortle/Blastoise</li>
         <li>Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan</li>
         <li>Omanyte/Omastar, Kabuto/Kabutops</li>
         <li>Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you have access to Pokémon Stadium, you can get an unlimited number of these by defeating the Elite Four and Rival repeatedly.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, if you have access to <strong>Red and Gen 1 only</strong>, you would want to follow the steps listed on the <a href="red-pokedex.html">Red and Gen 1 page</a>.<br>
         If you have access to <strong>Red, Gen 1, and Gen 2</strong>, you can follow the following steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Pick a starter and Omanyte or Kabuto on one Gen 1 game.</li>
         <li>On a second Gen 1 game, pick a second starter. Trade it to Gen 2.</li>
         <li>If you have a third Gen 1 game, pick the third starter, and trade it to Gen 2. If you don't, restart the second Gen 1 game, pick the third starter, and trade it to Gen 2.</li>
         <li>In Gen 2, breed all three Starters, the Eevee you get from Bill, and evolve the Tyrogue you get from Kiyo in Mt. Mortar and breed it. (Alternatively, you can also trade Eevee or Hitmonlee/Hitmonchan from Gen 1 to Gen 2 to breed.)</li>
         <li>Trade the bred Pokémon back to the Gen 1 game(s) you want to complete the Pokédex on and evolve them at will. Trade Omanyte and Kabuto around to any game that needs their Pokédex data before evolving them, or breed them in Gen 2.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This process allows you a little more freedom with regards to what evolutionary stage you trade when. The second game's first playthrough also only needs to 
         get the Starter before you can trade, instead of going all the way to Celadon for the Eeveelution.
      </p>
      <p>If you have access to <strong>Red and Gen 2 only</strong>, you can follow the following steps:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Pick a starter and a Omanyte or Kabuto. Trade them to Gen 2.</li>
         <li>Restart the game and pick a second starter. Trade it to Gen 2.</li>
         <li>Restart the game and pick the third starter and the other of Omanyte and Kabuto. Breed the starters and Omanyte or Kabuto in Gen 2. Breed the Eevee you get from Bill, and evolve the Tyrogue you get from Kiyo in Mt. Mortar and breed it. (Alternatively, you can also trade Eevee or Hitmonlee/Hitmonchan from Gen 1 to Gen 2 to breed.)</li>
         <li>Trade the bred Pokémon back to Red and evolve them at will.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><u>Trade Evolutions</u></h3>
      <p>Four Pokémon evolve by trading: Machoke, Graveler, Kadabra, and Haunter. The easiest way to get data for them is to trade them to another game and immediately trade 
         the newly-evolved Pokémon back.
