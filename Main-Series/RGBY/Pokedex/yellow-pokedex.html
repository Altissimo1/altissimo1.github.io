      <h2>Completing the Pokédex With Gen 1 (Pokémon Yellow)</h2>
      <p>There are 151 Pokémon in Yellow's Pokédex. Only 150 are needed to get the certificate from the Game Freak employee in Celadon City. The game 
         is programmed to accept <em>any</em> 150, meaning if you use the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mew_glitch">Mew glitch</a> to 
         get Mew, you can skip another Pokémon. This page focuses on getting the 150 Pokémon that aren't Mew.
      </p>
      <p>In order to complete the Pokédex in Pokémon Yellow with only Gen 1 games, you will need access to <em>at minimum</em> a copy of Pokémon Red and a copy of Pokémon Japanese Green/International Blue.</p>
      <h3><u>Version Exclusives</u></h3>
      <p>The following version-exclusive Pokémon have to be traded from another game:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Weedle, Kakuna, Beedrill (Red, Japanese Green/International Blue, or Japanese Blue)</li>
         <li>Ekans, Arbok (Red)</li>
         <li>Meowth, Persian (Japanese Green/International Blue or Japanese Blue)</li>
         <li>Koffing, Weezing (Red, Japanese Green/International Blue, or Japanese Blue)</li>
         <li>Jynx (Red, Japanese Green/International Blue, or Japanese Blue)</li>
         <li>Electabuzz (Red)</li>
         <li>Magmar (Green)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><u>Mutually Exclusive Pokémon</u></h3>
      <p>Several Pokémon are mutually exclusive, meaning that if you get one species, you cannot get at least one other species. The list of mutually exclusive species is below.</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan</li>
         <li>Omanyte/Omastar, Kabuto/Kabutops</li>
         <li>Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you have access to Pokémon Stadium, you can get an unlimited number of these by defeating the Elite Four and Rival repeatedly.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, you will need access to two games (Red and Green/Blue) anyway to finish the Pokédex. So, you can have each game evolve Eevee into a different Pokémon, and then 
         trade around to get all the Pokémon registered. Make sure that you trade each of Omanyte and Kabuto at each evolutionary stage!
      </p>
      <h3><u>Trade Evolutions</u></h3>
      <p>Four Pokémon evolve by trading: Machoke, Graveler, Kadabra, and Haunter. 
         You can get Machamp via in-game trade, meaning you will only need to trade for Golem, Haunter, and Alakazam. 
         The easiest way to get data for them is to trade them to another game and immediately trade the newly-evolved Pokémon back.
      </p>
      <h3><u>Raichu</u></h3>
      <p>You only get one Pikachu or Raichu in the game, and it is the Pikachu you start with. It will reject the Thunderstone, so you cannot get 
         a Raichu without trading. You can either trade for a Pikachu or Raichu from another version, or trade your starter Pikachu to another version, 
         evolve it there, and then trade it back. Note that if you do this, Pikachu will no longer follow you.
