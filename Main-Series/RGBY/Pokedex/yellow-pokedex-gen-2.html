      <h2>Completing the Pokédex With Gens 1 and 2 (Pokémon Yellow)</h2>
      <p>There are 151 Pokémon in Yellow's Pokédex. Only 150 are needed to get the certificate from the Game Freak employee in Celadon City. The game 
         is programmed to accept <em>any</em> 150, meaning if you use the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mew_glitch">Mew glitch</a> to 
         get Mew, you can skip another Pokémon. This page focuses on getting the 150 Pokémon that aren't Mew.
      </p>
      <p>In order to complete the Pokédex in Pokémon Yellow with Gen 1 and 2 games, you will need access to <em>at minimum</em> one of the following combinations:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>A copy of Pokémon Red and a copy of Pokémon Japanese Green/International Blue, or</li>
         <li>A copy of Pokémon Silver, or</li>
         <li>A copy of Pokémon Crystal</li>
      </ol>
      <h3><u>Version Exclusives</u></h3>
      <p>The following version-exclusive Pokémon have to be traded from another game:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Weedle, Kakuna, Beedrill (Red, Japanese Green/International Blue, Japanese Blue, Gold, Silver, or Crystal)</li>
         <li>Ekans, Arbok (Red, Gold, Silver, or Crystal)</li>
         <li>Meowth, Persian (Japanese Green/International Blue, Japanese Blue, Silver, or Crystal)</li>
         <li>Koffing, Weezing (Red, Japanese Green/International Blue, Japanese Blue, Gold, Silver, or Crystal)</li>
         <li>Jynx (Red, Japanese Green/International Blue, Japanese Blue, Gold, Silver, or Crystal)</li>
         <li>Electabuzz (Red, Gold, Silver, or Crystal)</li>
         <li>Magmar (Green, Gold, Silver, or Crystal)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><u>Mutually Exclusive Pokémon</u></h3>
      <p>Several Pokémon are mutually exclusive, meaning that if you get one species, you cannot get at least one other species. The list of mutually exclusive species is below.</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan</li>
         <li>Omanyte/Omastar, Kabuto/Kabutops</li>
         <li>Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you have access to Pokémon Stadium, you can get an unlimited number of these by defeating the Elite Four and Rival repeatedly.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, if you have access to <strong>Yellow and Gen 1 only</strong>, you would want to follow the steps listed on the <a href="yellow-pokedex.html">Yellow and Gen 1 page</a>.<br>
         If you have access to <strong>Yellow, Gen 1, and Gen 2</strong>, you can follow the following steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Pick Omanyte or Kabuto on one Gen 1 game.</li>
         <li>On the second Gen 1 game, pick the other of Omanyte and Kabuto.</li>
         <li>In Gen 2, breed the Eevee you get from Bill, and evolve the Tyrogue you get from Kiyo in Mt. Mortar and breed it. (Alternatively, you can also trade Eevee or Hitmonlee/Hitmonchan from Gen 1 to Gen 2 to breed.)</li>
         <li>Trade the bred Pokémon back to the Gen 1 game(s) you want to complete the Pokédex on and evolve them at will. Trade Omanyte and Kabuto around to any game that needs their Pokédex data before evolving them, or breed them in Gen 2.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you have access to <strong>Yellow and Gen 2</strong>, you can follow the following steps:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Pick Omanyte or Kabuto. Trade it to Gen 2.</li>
         <li>Restart the game and pick the other of Omanyte and Kabuto. Breed Omanyte or Kabuto in Gen 2, or simply keep it unevolved.</li>
         <li>Breed the Eevee you get from Bill, and evolve the Tyrogue you get from Kiyo in Mt. Mortar and breed it. (Alternatively, you can also trade Eevee or Hitmonlee/Hitmonchan from Gen 1 to Gen 2 to breed.)</li>
         <li>Trade the bred Pokémon back to Yellow.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><u>Trade Evolutions</u></h3>
      <p>Four Pokémon evolve by trading: Machoke, Graveler, Kadabra, and Haunter. 
         You can get Machamp via in-game trade, meaning you will only need to trade for Golem, Haunter, and Alakazam. 
         The easiest way to get data for them is to trade them to another game and immediately trade the newly-evolved Pokémon back.
      </p>
      <h3><u>Raichu</u></h3>
      <p>You only get one Pikachu or Raichu in the game, and it is the Pikachu you start with. It will reject the Thunderstone, so you cannot get 
         a Raichu without trading. You can either trade for a Pikachu or Raichu from another version, or trade your starter Pikachu to another version, 
         evolve it there, and then trade it back. Note that if you do this, Pikachu will no longer follow you.
