      <h2>FireRed and LeafGreen Home</h2>
      <p>FireRed and LeafGreen were released for the Game Boy Advance in 2004. They are remakes of <a href="../RGBY/index.html">Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow</a>. They are compatible with each other, as well as Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald, also for the Game Boy Advance. Using a Game Boy Advance to GameCube Link Cable, Pokémon can be traded from these games to Colosseum and XD. Using the Game Boy Advance slot of an original model DS, Pokémon can be sent to Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold and SoulSilver, although they cannot be returned from these games to any Game Boy Advance or GameCube game.</p>
      <p>The first 386 Pokémon are all programmed into the game. Between the two games, the player can access the first 150 Pokémon, as well as a handful of Johto Pokémon. Pokémon that are missing from this game can be traded in from Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Colosseum, or XD.</p>
