      <h2>HeartGold and SoulSilver Time Events</h2>
      <p>HeartGold and SoulSilver use the DS' internal clock to track the passage of time and days of the week. Several events in HeartGold and SoulSilver utilize the clock. Some events only occur on certain days of the week, some Pokémon and Trainers can only be battled at certain times of day, and some events are available only once a day, becoming available again after the clock passes midnight. This page provides information about the events that are tied to the clock.</p>
      <h3><u>Daily Events</u></h3>
      <p>These events require the start of a new day, but do not require a specific time of day or day of the week otherwise.</p>
      <ul>
         <li><a href="apricorns.html">Apricorns</a> can be collected once a day.</li>
         <li>If Kurt is given an Apricorn to make a custom Poké Ball with, he will have it available for the player the following day.</li>
         <li>The Lottery Corner in <a href="../Johto-Locations/goldenrod-radio-tower.html?hgss">Goldenrod Radio Tower</a> can be played once a day.</li>
         <li>The Shuckle that the player can receive from <a href="../Johto-Locations/cianwood-city.html?hgss">Kirk</a> can be returned to him the following day.</li>
         <li>A Trainer can be battled in the <a href="../Kanto-Locations/viridian-city.html?hgss">Viridian City</a> Trainer House once every day.</li>
         <li>After defeating the Elite Four, the player can tune in to Professor Oak's Pokémon Talk to hear which Pokémon is currently Swarming. The species that is Swarming changes every day.</li>
         <li>The old man on <a href="../Kanto-Locations/route-16.html?hgss">Route 16</a> will teach the player a new trendy phrase once a day.</li>
         <li>The girl in the northeastern house in <a href="../Johto-Locations/olivine-city.html?hgss">Olivine City</a> will give the player three random Seals once per day.</li>
         <li>At midnight, the counters on <a href="../Johto-Locations/safari-zone.html?hgss">Safari Zone</a> areas increase by 1 for the purposes of determining how long the area has been active.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All of the above events can be obtained repeatedly by setting the DS' clock to 11:59 PM (23:59) and allowing it to roll over to the next day. However, Safari Zone areas cannot be leveled up repeatedly this way, as the game will freeze the clock for the Safari Zone for 24 hours after the time is changed.</p>
      <h3><u>Time Events</u></h3>
      <p>These events require a specific time of day, but do not require a specific day of the week.</p>
      <p>The three times of day that the game uses are Morning, Day, and Night. Morning lasts from 4:00 AM-9:59 AM (04:00-09:59), Day lasts from 10:00 AM-7:59 PM (10:00-19:59), and Night lasts from 8:00 PM-3:59 AM (20:00-03:59).</p>
      <p>Many Pokémon can only be found during one of these three times, but I have not compiled the full list here as it's pretty extensive.</p>
