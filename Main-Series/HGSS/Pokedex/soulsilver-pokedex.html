      <h2>Completing (Most of) the Pokédex With HeartGold and SoulSilver (Pokémon HeartGold)</h2>
      <p>SoulSilver has two separate Pokédexes to complete: the Johto Pokédex and the National Pokédex. The Johto Pokédex corresponds to the Dex in the original Gold, Silver, and Crystal games (Pokémon 1-251), with the addition of Tangrowth, Mamoswine, Lickilicky, Yanmega, and Ambipom.
	   The National Pokédex consists of the Johto Pokédex plus the Pokémon introduced in Ruby, Sapphire, & Emerald and Diamond, Pearl, & Platinum (Pokémon 252-493). All Pokémon from the Johto Pokédex, except for the event-exclusive Mew and Celebi, are available between HeartGold and SoulSilver. 
	   Most of the remaining Pokémon are also available, but there are a few exceptions, making it impossible to complete the National Pokédex with access to only those two games. This page will show the maximum number of Pokémon that <em>can</em> be obtained.</p>
	  <p>The maximum number of Pokémon you can get this way is <strong>428</strong>, or <strong>449</strong> with access to the Pokéwalker.</p>
      <h3><u>Version Exclusives</u></h3>
      <p>The following version-exclusive Pokémon have to be traded from HeartGold:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Growlithe, Arcanine</li>
         <li>Mankey, Primeape</li>
         <li>Omanyte, Omastar (alternatively, a Helix Fossil can be traded from HeartGold and revived at the Pewter Museum)</li>
         <li>Spinarak, Ariados</li>
         <li>Phanpy, Donphan</li>
         <li>Gligar, Gliscor</li>
		 <li>Mantyke, Mantine</li>
		 <li>Sableye</li>
		 <li>Baltoy, Claydol</li>
		 <li>Anorith, Armaldo (alternatively, a Claw Fossil can be traded from HeartGold and revived at the Pewter Museum)</li>
		 <li>Latias</li>
		 <li>Kyogre</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>Trading Kyogre from HeartGold is additionally the only way to get the Rayquaza that appears at the Embedded Tower.</p>
      <h3><u>Mutually Exclusive Pokémon</u></h3>
      <p>Several Pokémon are mutually exclusive, meaning that if you get one species, you cannot get at least one other species. The list of mutually exclusive species is below.</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Chikorita/Bayleef/Meganium, Cyndaquil/Quilava/Typhlosion, Totodile/Croconaw/Feraligatr</li>
         <li>Bulbasaur/Ivysaur/Venusaur, Charmander/Charmeleon/Charizard, Squirtle/Wartortle/Blastoise</li>
         <li>Treecko/Grovyle/Sceptile, Torchic/Combusken/Blaziken, Mudkip/Marshtomp/Swampert</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You will need <em>at minimum</em> three separate save files to get each of these starters. Each save file will pick three different starters from this list, and they can be bred and traded as needed.</p>
      <h3><u>Trade Evolutions</u></h3>
      <p>17 Pokémon evolve by trading: Golem, Machamp, Alakazam, Gengar, Politoed, Slowking, Steelix, Scizor, Kingdra, Porygon2, Huntail, Gorebyss, Rhyperior, Electivire, Magmortar, Porygon-Z, and Dusknoir. The easiest way to get data for them is to trade them to another game and immediately trade the newly-evolved Pokémon back.</p>
      <p>You will need two King's Rocks, two Metal Coats, one Dragon Scale, one Up-Grade, one DeepSeaTooth, one DeepSeaScale, one Protector, one Electirizer, one Magmarizer, one Dubious Disc, and one Reaper Cloth to evolve Politoed, Slowking, Steelix, Scizor, Kingdra, Porygon2, Huntail, Gorebyss, Rhyperior, Electivire, Magmortar, Porygon-Z, and Dusknoir.</p>
      <h3><u>Pokéwalker Pokémon</u></h3>
	  <p>If you have access to the Pokéwalker, you can obtain the following Pokémon: Skitty, Delcatty, Carvanha, Sharpedo, Wailmer, Wailord, Feebas, Milotic, Castform, Kecleon, Tropius, Snorunt, Glalie, Froslass, Shellos, Gastrodon (West Sea only), Spiritomb, Finneon, Lumineon, Snover, and Abomasnow.<br>East Sea Shellos and Gastrodon must still be traded from Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum.</p>
	  <h3><u>Missing Pokémon</u></h3>
      <p>The remaining Pokémon are obtainable only in Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, or defunct events.</p>
      <dl>
         <dt>Hoenn Legendaries (3) - 3 total</dt>
         <dd>Regirock, Regice, and Registeel can only be obtained in Platinum, if that game has access to an event Regigigas. Otherwise, they will need to be traded from Ruby, Sapphire, or Emerald. Either way, they are not accessible in HeartGold and SoulSilver.</dd>
         <dt>Sinnoh Starters (9) - 12 total</dt>
         <dd>Turtwig, Grotle, Torterra, Chimchar, Monferno, Infernape, Piplup, Prinplup, and Empoleon all need to be selected as a starter in Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum, and cannot be obtained in HeartGold and SoulSilver.</dd>
         <dt>Sinnoh Fossil Pokémon (4) - 16 total</dt>
         <dd>The Skull and Armor Fossils are only obtainable in Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum. The Fossils can be traded directly to HeartGold and SoulSilver and revived at the Pewter Museum.</dd>
		 <dt>Sinnoh Pokémon (7) - 23 total</dt>
		 <dd>Drifloon, Drifblim, Glameow, Purugly, Stunky, Skuntank, and Rotom must be traded from Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum.</dd>
		 <dt>Missing Location Pokémon (4) - 27 total</dt>
		 <dd>Although their pre-evolutions are obtainable in HeartGold and SoulSilver, Magnezone, Probopass, Leafeon, and Glaceon cannot be evolved as the locations needed to evolve them do not exist in HeartGold and SoulSilver. They must instead be evolved in Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum.</dd>
         <dt>Sinnoh Legendaries (8) - 35 total</dt>
		 <dd>Uxie, Mesprit, Azelf, Dialga, Palkia, Heatran, Regigigas, Giratina, and Cresselia must be traded from Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum. Technically, Dialga, Palkia, or Giratina can be obtained with access to an event Arceus, but that Arceus must be traded from Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum.</dd>
		 <dt>Mythical/Event (9) - <strong>44</strong> total</dt>
         <dd>The following Pokémon must be obtained via event: Mew, Celebi, Jirachi, Deoxys, Phione, Manaphy, Darkrai, Shaymin and Arceus.</dd>
      </dl>
	  <p>If the player does not have access to the Pokéwalker, this total is instead <strong>65</strong>.</p>
