      <h2>HeartGold and SoulSilver Home</h2>
      <p>HeartGold and SoulSilver were released for the Nintendo DS in 2009 (Japan) and 2010 (international regions). They are remakes of <a href="../GSC/index.html">Gold, Silver, and Crystal</a>. They are compatible with each other, as well as Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum, also for the Nintendo DS. They are capable of communicating with the Nintendo Wii, allowing the player to use Pokémon from these games in Pokémon Battle Revolution. Using the Game Boy Advance slot of an original model DS, Pokémon from Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed, and LeafGreen can be sent to these games, although they cannot be returned to any Game Boy Advance or GameCube game. Pokémon from HeartGold and SoulSilver can be sent to Black, White, Black 2, and White 2, although they cannot be returned from these games. The Pokéwalker accessory was released alongside HeartGold and SoulSilver and allows players to catch rare Pokémon and find rare items, which can be sent to HeartGold and SoulSilver.</p>
      <p>The first 493 Pokémon are all programmed into the game. Between the two games, the player can access the first 250 Pokémon (excluding Mew), as well as most Hoenn and Sinnoh Pokémon. Pokémon that are missing from this game can be traded in from Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum, or transferred from Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed, or LeafGreen.</p>
