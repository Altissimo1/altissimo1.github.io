      <h2>Battle Factory</h2>
      <p>The Battle Factory is one of five facilities located in the <a href="../Sinnoh-Locations/battle-frontier.html">Battle Frontier</a>, accessible in Platinum, HeartGold, and SoulSilver. The Frontier Brain here is Thorton.</p>
      <h3><u>Modes</u></h3>
      <p>As with all Facilities, the Battle Factory has options for Single Battles, Double Battles, and Multi Battles. Multi Battles are conducted with a second player with their own copy of Platinum, HeartGold, or SoulSilver.</p>
      <p>The player can enter three Pokémon in Singles, three in Doubles, and two in Multi (with the other player providing another two).</p>
      <h3><u>Mechanics</u></h3>
      <h4>Gimmick</h4>
      <p>Before every round of seven Trainers, the player will be provided a draft of six Pokémon, taken from the <a href="battle-frontier-pokemon.html">list</a> used by all facilities other than the Battle Hall. Genders and abilities for these Pokémon are random. The player must select their Pokémon from the list of six. After every battle, the player will be given the option to trade one of their Pokémon for one Pokémon they just faced in the previous battle. In Multis, both players will be given their own draft of six and will be asked to select two. After a battle, one of the two players can trade for any of the four opposing Pokémon.</p>
      <p>Swapping with the opponent frequently will allow the player to access Pokémon from higher tiers and with better IVs than normal in the draft they are given at the start of the round.</p>
      <p>The player is also given some advance information about the team of the upcoming Trainer before they choose whether to swap a Pokémon, allowing the player to build their team according to what the next Trainer will have.</p>
      <p>All Trainers faced also have their Pokémon generated randomly from a specific tier.</p>
      <h4>General</h4>
      <p>Mechanics that apply to every Facility are on the <a href="../Sinnoh-Locations/battle-frontier.html">Battle Frontier page.</a> Here are mechanics specific to the Battle Factory:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Two Pokémon of the same species, or with the same held item, will never be offered in the player's draft.</li>
         <li>Opposing Trainers will never use two Pokémon of the same species, or with the same held item.</li>
         <li>The first Trainer in a round will never use a Pokémon species or held item that was offered in the player's draft. Subsequent Trainers will never use a species or held item that was used by the previous Trainer, or one that is in the player's current team.</li>
         <li>There are two modes offered: Level 50 and Open Level (Level 100). Which mode is chosen determines where in the tier system (see the <a href="battle-frontier-pokemon.html">Pokémon list</a> for more about the tiers) the player will start. All Pokémon the player can choose from or battle in a mode will be set to the level of that mode.</li>
         <li>The player's Pokémon will be automatically healed after every battle.</li>
         <li>Items used or swapped (via Trick, Thief, Switcheroo, Covet, Knock Off, or Fling) during the battle will be given back to the Pokémon after the battle.</li>
         <li>Battles are conducted in rounds of 7. The player can save between battles in a round, but will not be able to do anything except complete the rest of the round when they load the game. The player can do anything between rounds without it affecting their streak.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3><u>Frontier Brain</u></h3>
      <p>The Frontier Brain, Thorton, is battled first after 20 battles and again after 48. He uses a random team that will be selected from a specific tier of Pokémon. His Pokémon have 12 IVs in his Silver Print battle and 31 in his Gold Print battle.</p>
      <p>The tier of Pokémon that Thorton can choose from depends on whether it is the first or second battle, the mode chosen (Level 50 or Open Level), and the game being played. It seems to be the case that early versions of Platinum (potentially the Japanese and American releases?) accidentally had some incorrect data for him, which were fixed in later versions of Platinum, as well as all versions of HeartGold and SoulSilver.</p>
      <ul>
         <li>In Level 50, in his Silver Print battle, Thorton will use Set-1 High Tier Pokémon in all versions.</li>
         <li>In Level 50, in his Gold Print battle, Thorton will use Set-1 High Tier Pokémon in early versions of Platinum, and Set-4 High Tier and any Legendary Tier Pokémon in later versions, HeartGold, and SoulSilver.</li>
         <li>In Open Level, in his Silver Print battle, Thorton will use Set-4 High Tier and any Legendary Tier Pokémon in early versions of Platinum, and Set-1 High Tier Pokémon in later versions, HeartGold, and SoulSilver.</li>
         <li>In Open Level, in his Gold Print battle, Thorton will use Set-4 High Tier and any Legendary Tier Pokémon in all versions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I don't know exactly which versions of Platinum are affected, but I do know that Japanese releases and Revisions 0 and 1 of the North American release are "early versions", and at least the Italian version is a "later version". Thanks to Sandy Beach for requesting clarification.</p>
      <h3><u>Trainers and Pokémon</u></h3>
      <p>The list of Trainers that can be encountered is located <a href="battle-frontier-trainers.html">here</a>. The list of Pokémon that can be encountered is located <a href="battle-frontier-pokemon.html">here</a>.</p>
      <p>The player's draft of six Pokémon at the beginning of a round will have their IVs determined by the round, as shown in the following table. The player can get Pokémon with higher IVs by swapping frequently, as discussed below.</p>

      <h3><u>Swapping Mechanics</u></h3>
      <p>The amount of times the player swaps Pokémon with the opponent can affect the quality of the Pokémon they receive in the draft at the start of a round. This only applies to battles before 50; after that point, the player's Pokémon always have 31 IVs and any High or Legendary Tier set can be chosen.</p>
      <p>The number of Pokémon in a draft that will be 'upgraded' is dependent on the total number of swaps the player has made across their whole streak. An upgraded Pokémon will have IVs 4 higher than a non-upgraded Pokémon, and their moveset will be taken from the next tier than the one associated with the current round (see <a href="battle-frontier-pokemon.html">the Pokémon page</a> for details about tiers and the Battle Factory modes). The following table shows the number of swaps needed. Note that choosing Pokémon from the opening draft counts as a 'swap'. A maximum of 7 swaps (including the draft) can be made per round.</p>
      <table>
         <thead>
            <tr class="light-true">
               <th>Swaps</th>
               <th>Upgraded Pokémon</th>
            </tr>

            </tr>
            <tr class="light-true">
               <td>7-13</td>

            </tr>
            <tr class="light-false">

               <td>2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="light-true">
               <td>21-27</td>

               <td>5</td>
            </tr>
         </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>When the player's current tier of Pokémon is Set-4 High Tier (which will be battles 43-49 for Level 50 or 22-28 for Open Level), an upgraded Pokémon can come from any set in the High and Legendary Tiers.</p>
      <h3><u>Opponent Preview</u></h3>
