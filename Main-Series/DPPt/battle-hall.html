      <h2>Battle Hall</h2>
      <p>The Battle Hall is one of five facilities located in the <a href="../Sinnoh-Locations/battle-frontier.html">Battle Frontier</a>, accessible in Platinum, HeartGold, and SoulSilver. The Frontier Brain here is Argenta.</p>
      <h3><u>Modes</u></h3>
      <p>As with all Facilities, the Battle Tower has options for Single Battles, Double Battles, and Multi Battles. Multi Battles are conducted with a second player with their own copy of Platinum, HeartGold, or SoulSilver.</p>
      <p>The player can enter one Pokémon in Singles, two in Doubles, and one in Multi (with the other player providing another one). In Doubles and Multis, both Pokémon entered must be the same species.</p>
      <h3><u>Mechanics</u></h3>
      <h4>Gimmick</h4>
      <p>Every battle is either a one-on-one (Singles) or a two-on-two (Doubles and Multis). In Doubles and Multis, the player must enter two of the same species of Pokémon, and opposing Trainers will only use two of the same Pokémon. Each battle effectively becomes a test to see how well a given species of Pokémon can defeat another species without assistance.</p>
      <p>Although an ongoing streak can only exist for one species at a time, the game does keep track of the player's greatest streak with <em>every</em> species of Pokémon, and the player can receive rewards for building high overall streaks.</p>
      <h4>General</h4>
      <p>Mechanics that apply to every Facility are on the <a href="../Sinnoh-Locations/battle-frontier.html">Battle Frontier page.</a> Here are mechanics specific to the Battle Hall:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>In Doubles or Multis, the player must enter the same species of Pokémon twice.</li>
         <li>In Doubles or Multis, the player may enter two Pokémon with the same held item.</li>
         <li>Before a battle, a player must select one of the seventeen types to fight. The opposing Pokémon will always belong to the selected type, unless the battle is against the Frontier Brain.</li>
         <li>The player can only enter Pokémon at level 30 or above. They will not have their level adjusted. The levels of opponents' Pokémon will scale according to the player's, as outlined <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Battle_Hall#Challenges">here</a>.</li>
         <li>In Doubles or Multis, the opponent will have two Pokémon of the same species. They will have identical stats and movesets, as each enemy Pokémon in the Battle Hall has only one associated moveset.</li>
         <li>The player's Pokémon will be automatically healed after every battle.</li>
         <li>Battles are conducted in rounds of 10. The player can save between battles in a round, but will not be able to do anything except complete the rest of the round when they load the game. The player can do anything between rounds without it affecting their streak.</li>
         <li>Items used or swapped (via Trick, Thief, Switcheroo, Covet, Knock Off, or Fling) during the battle will be given back to the Pokémon after the battle.</li>
		 <li>Although a streak requires the player to use the same species, the player can enter different individuals of the same species, allowing them to build a moveset or even stat spread specific to the type they are choosing to face.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><u>Resources</u></h3>
      <ul>
         <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18Dt32hsBWC3My01u8IYfMueTk6WrIU2r/edit?gid=1306002660#gid=1306002660">Speed stats</a> for opposing Pokémon, assuming the player's is at level 100</li>
         <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uU_MuXklN33Pc47CZe3QHpP_OcLR9YqSoJCDfZBamiw/edit?gid=1727920622#gid=1727920622">All opposing Pokmon sets</a>, grouped by type, and with Pokémon that can appear after battle 170 listed below the delimiter</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><u>Ranks</u></h3>
      <p>When the player first begins a streak in the Battle Hall, they will see that all types are set to Rank 1. After a player successfully completes a battle, the rank will increase by 1, up to a maximum of 10. When Rank 10 is reached, the player will be unable to select that type again until all types have achieved Rank 10.</p>
      <p>Upon achieving Rank 10 in all types, when a player starts a round, they will be able to select from any type at Rank 10. After completing the battle, the type is unselectable until the player has defeated every type. At that point, all types become available again. Because rounds are conducted in sets of ten battles, but there are seventeen types, this means the point at which the types 'reset' may occur in the middle of a round.</p>
      <p>In Multi Battles, the player will always start a streak facing Rank 10 enemies. Upon finishing a round of ten battles, the types will reset, meaning that in Multi Battles, the player only ever needs to face ten of the seventeen types if they so choose.</p>
      <h3><u>Frontier Brain</u></h3>
      <p>The Frontier Brain, Argenta, is battled first after 49 battles and again after 169. For her Silver Print battle, she will use a random Pokémon from the same Group as the player's (see the <a href="battle-hall-pokemon.html">Battle Hall Pokémon</a> page for an explanation of groups). For her Gold Print battle, she will use a random Pokémon from Group 4. In both cases, the type of the Pokémon does not need to match the type selected by the player. In both battles, her Pokémon will have 31 IVs and match the level of the player's Pokémon.</p>
      <h3><u>Pokémon</u></h3>
      <p>The list of Pokémon that can be encountered is located <a href="battle-hall-pokemon.html">here</a>.</p>
      <h3><u>Battle Points</u></h3>
      <p>The following table contains the amount of Battle Points the player will receive for finishing each round of ten battles. Defeating the Frontier Brain will always give the player 20 Points for that round. All Multi Battle rounds give 12 Points.</p>

      <p>Additionally, every time the player completes a round of ten battles, the game will calculate if the player's total win streak (their combined wins with all species of Pokémon) has passed certain thresholds. If the player passes a threshold, they will receive extra BP for their achievement. Note that each of these 'bonus' BP payouts can only be received once, as the total win streak can only ever increase.</p>
      <ul>
         <li>1 BP for 10 wins</li>
         <li>3 BP for 30 wins</li>
         <li>5 BP, starting at 50 wins, for each multiple of 50 until 450</li>
         <li>10 BP, starting at 500 wins, for each multiple of 100 until 1000</li>
         <li>30 BP, starting at 1200 wins, for each multiple of 200 until 1800</li>
         <li>50 BP, starting at 2000 wins, for each multiple of 500 until 9500</li>
         <li>The player's record divided by 100 BP, starting at 10000 wins, for each multiple of 10000 until 100000</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><u>Fans</u></h3>
      <p>The characters that appear in the lobby of the Battle Hall, and their dialogue, can be affected by the player's progress in the Battle Hall. Specific familiar characters can appear on the cushions south of the TV near where the player starts their challenge. Which character can appear here depends on the player's total win streak.</p>

      <p>One character that appears in the lobby - named Winston if the player character is female and Serena if they are male - will also progressively get closer to the entry point to the Hall and gain different dialogue depending on how many species of Pokémon the player has won at least one battle with in the Battle Hall. This character will gain new dialogue for each of the following milestones.</p>
