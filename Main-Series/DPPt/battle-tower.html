      <h3><u>Rewards</u></h3>
      <p>The player can get the following rewards for victories here. Trophies can be placed in the player's Secret Base in the Underground.</p>

      <p>Additionally, attaining Rank 5 in the Wi-Fi Battle Room will confer the World Ability Ribbon on the Pokémon entered.</p>
      <h3><u>Modes</u></h3>
      <p>The Battle Tower has options for Single Battles, Double Battles, and Multi Battles. Multi Battles can be conducted with either an AI-controlled partner Trainer or a second player with their own copy of Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, or SoulSilver.</p>
      <p>The player can also choose to challenge the Wi-Fi Battle Room. Between the games' release and 20 May 2014 (when the servers were shut down), players could connect to the Internet, download the teams of other players that had already challenged the Wi-Fi Battle Room, and battle those teams (controlled by the AI). If the player won many consecutive battles, they would be able to rank up (from rank 1 through 10) and upload their own team's data for other Trainers to fight. Despite the shutdown of the official servers, fan-run servers have been created that allow players to access this feature again. The Wi-Fi Battle Room seems to have been poorly researched; a lot of players in the games' early days reported running into hacked teams (as there were no checks on what the player could upload beyond what was forbidden to be entered in the first place), so interest seems to have never been as high for this as it was for the AI challenges.</p>
      <p>The player can enter three Pokémon in Singles, four in Doubles, and two in Multi (with the AI partner or the other player providing another two).</p>
      <h3><u>Mechanics</u></h3>
      <ul>
         <li>The player will not receive money, and their Pokémon will not receive experience. Instead, the player will receive BP, which is used as a currency for purchasable items in the Battle Park.</li>
         <li>Set Mode is enforced.</li>
         <li>The moves Return and Frustration, when used by the opponent, will always have their maximum power.</li>
         <li>Losing a battle will reset the player's streak to 0. Turning off the game mid-battle, or mid-round without saving, will count as a loss and reset the streak.</li>
         <li>Pokémon encountered in battles will not be added to the Pokédex.</li>
         <li>Defeating Palmer will give the player 20BP.</li>
         <li>Enemy Pokémon will always take their Item, moves, and EVs from predetermined 'sets'.</li>
         <li>Enemy Pokémon that can have two Abilities will always have a random Ability. Enemy Pokémon that can be male or female will have their gender randomly determined. Enemy Pokémon always have random natures.</li>
         <li>Any Pokémon holding a Soul Dew cannot enter.</li>
         <li>Two Pokémon of the same species cannot be entered.</li>
         <li>Two Pokémon holding the same item cannot be entered, except in Multi Battles (where they must be selected by different Trainers).</li>
         <li>The player's Pokémon will be set to level 50 if they are higher than 50. Pokémon lower than level 50 will not be leveled up to 50. The opponent's Pokémon will always be level 50.</li>
         <li>The opponent's team will never have two of the same Pokémon, or two Pokémon holding the same item.</li>
         <li>The player's Pokémon will be automatically healed after every battle.</li>
         <li>Battles are conducted in rounds of 7. The player can save between battles in a round, but will not be able to do anything except complete the rest of the round when they load the game. The player can do anything between rounds without it affecting their streak.</li>
         <li>Items used or swapped (via Trick, Thief, Switcheroo, Covet, Knock Off, or Fling) during the battle will be given back to the Pokémon after the battle.</li>
         <li>Some Pokémon cannot be entered altogether, and will never be encountered on an opponent's team:</li>

      <h3><u>Tower Tycoon</u></h3>
      <p>The Tower Tycoon, Palmer, is battled first after 20 battles and again after 48. He will always use the same three Pokémon in each of his battles, but they can be in any order. His Pokémon have 31 IVs in both battles. The gender, Ability, and Nature of his Pokémon are random. His teams are as follows:</p>
