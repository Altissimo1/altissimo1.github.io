      <h2>Pokémon Pinball Series</h2>
      <p>The Pokémon Pinball games are a duo of games that mix traditional pinball mechanics with Pokémon-catching mechanics, released between 1999 and 2003. Your pinball is a Poké Ball, and you catch Pokémon by unlocking them on screen by hitting board elements, and then hitting the Pokémon itself to catch it. They can be evolved via interaction with other board elements.</p>
