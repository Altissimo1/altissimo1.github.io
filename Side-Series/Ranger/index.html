      <h2>Pokémon Ranger Series</h2>
      <p>The Pokémon Ranger games are a series of action-adventure games, with 3 released games between 2006 and 2010. In these games, you play as a Pokémon Ranger, who can capture Pokémon by drawing loops around them (using the DS' touch screen) with their Capture Styler and use the Pokémon's abilities to clear obstacles, assist in captures, or complete missions.</p>
      <p>The following games are part of the series:</p>
      <ul>
         <li><a href="Ranger/index.html">Pokémon Ranger</a>: Released for the DS in 2006 (all regions except Europe) and 2007 (Europe). 213 of the first 386 Pokémon can be obtained, and the player can also obtain a Manaphy egg that can be sent to Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, or SoulSilver once per save file with a special mission.</li>
         <li>Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia: Released for the DS in 2008. 267 of the first 493 Pokémon can be obtained, and the player can also obtain a Manaphy egg, a special Riolu, and Darkrai that can be sent to Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, or SoulSilver. Further special missions allow the player to capture Dialga, Palkia, and Shaymin, but these cannot be sent to other games.</li>
         <li>Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs: Released for the DS in 2010. 301 of the first 493 Pokémon can be obtained, and the player can also obtain a Manaphy egg, Deoxys, Heatran, and Shaymin that can be sent to Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, or SoulSilver. Further special missions allow the player to capture Dialga, Palkia, Giratina, and Arceus, but these cannot be sent to other games. This game also features a series of 'past missions', designed with multiplayer in mind, that use a separate Browser from the main story; some Pokémon are only in one Browser, and others are in both. 222 Pokémon can be captured in past missions, and the aforementioned obtainable Deoxys is in a past mission that registers Deoxys in the past Browser.</li>
      </ul>
