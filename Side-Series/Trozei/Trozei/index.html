      <h2>Pokémon Trozei (Game)</h2>
      <p>The first game in the Pokémon Trozei series, itself called Pokémon Trozei (or Pokémon Link in Europe), was released in 2005 in Japan, 2006 in all other regions except South Korea, and 2007 in South Korea. This game contains the first 386 Pokémon, although Legendaries cannot be obtained without the ability to communicate with other Pokémon Trozei players.</p>
      <p>Information about this game is difficult to come by and multiple sources often contain contradictory information. Some of the information that remains unknown includes:
	  <ul>
		<li>The exact rarity values of rare Pokémon</li>
		<li>The exact mechanics by which Legendary Pokémon can be obtained</li>
		<li>The exact odds of getting any specific rare Pokémon (including Legendaries) as the player's Agent Card Pokémon</li>
		<li>What games Trozei is compatible with (Mystery Dungeon Blue Rescue Team, for instance) and if there's anything unique to be gained from connecting to these games</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <p>SaltedNeos, ShinxHijinx, and myself have completed a location data dump of the game, which is to our knowledge the first such dump. The pages below use information from this dump, and therefore contain some differences from for example Bulbapedia. To the best of our knowledge, Legendary Pokémon are unobtainable except by using Espionage Mode and communicating with a Trozei cartridge that has a Legendary Pokémon in its Agent Card. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odF4JyW_jLY">This video</a> by SaltedNeos contains the most current knowledge based on our discussions after dumping the location data. <strong>If you happen to have any further knowledge about this game, please <a href="../../../Maintenance/contact.html">contact me</a>!</strong></p>
