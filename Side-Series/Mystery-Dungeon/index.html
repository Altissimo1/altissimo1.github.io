      <h2>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon</h2>
      <p>The Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games are a series of dungeon-crawling games, or "roguelikes" / "rogue-lites" (depending on who you ask), with 6 released games (or game sets) between 2006 and 2020. In these games, you play as a Pokémon, and explore randomly generated areas called dungeons, where you can collect randomly generated items and defeat enemy Pokémon, which have a chance to join your party after defeat.</p>
      <p>The following games are part of the series:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team: Released simultaneously for the DS and Game Boy Advance, respectively, in 2005 (Japan), 2006 (North America, Australia, and Europe), and 2007 (South Korea). Between the two games, the first 386 Pokémon are obtainable (Bulbasaur through Deoxys), with cameos from Munchlax, Lucario, Mime Jr., Bonsly, and Weavile.</li>
         <li><a href="Explorers/index.html">Explorers of Time, Explorers of Darkness, and Explorers of Sky</a>: The first two entries were released for the DS in 2007 in Japan and 2008 elsewhere. The third entry is Explorers of Sky, which was released in 2009 and adds quality-of-life changes and additional content. In Time and Darkness, the first 491 Pokémon are available (Bulbasaur through Darkrai), and Sky adds the ability to recruit Shaymin and a cameo from Arceus.</li>
         <li>Radiant Adventure Squad, Wildfire Adventure Squad, and Tempest Adventure Squad: These games were released for the WiiWare service on the Wii in 2009, in Japan only. An English-language fan translation was completed in 2020 and can be found <a href="https://projectpokemon.org/home/index/news/pok%C3%A9mon-mystery-dungeon-wiiware-fan-translation-r138/">here</a>. Between these three games, the first 493 Pokémon are available (Bulbasaur through Arceus).</li>
         <li>Gates to Infinity: Released for the 3DS in 2012 in Japan and 2013 elsewhere. This game, unlike its predecessors, allows only 144 Pokémon to be recruited - most of which were introduced in Black and White - with a handful of cameos from other Pokémon.</li>
         <li><a href="Super-Mystery-Dungeon/index.html">Super Mystery Dungeon</a>: Released for the 3DS in 2015 (Japan and North America) and 2016 (Europe and Australia). The first 720 Pokémon are obtainable (Bulbasaur through Hoopa). The recruitment system used in this game is completely different from those used by the other games; in Super, you recruit Pokémon by completing pre-defined missions for them, and they can at times introduce you to their (pre-defined) friends.</li>
         <li>Rescue Team DX: Released for the Switch in 2020. This is a remake of Blue and Red Rescue Teams, and largely returns to using the mechanics introduced in those games rather than keeping the changes made in Super Mystery Dungeon. Like the original, the first 386 Pokémon are obtainable. Pokémon that were released in generations 4 or 6 that are related to existing Pokémon (such as Magmortar and Sylveon) were added, and Riolu and Lucario are also obtainable.</li>
      </ul>
