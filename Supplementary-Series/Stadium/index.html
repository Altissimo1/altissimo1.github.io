      <h2>Pokémon Stadium</h2>
      <p>The Pokémon Stadium games are a series of console games released for the Nintendo 64 between 1998 and 2001. These games can connect to the player's Game Boy Pokémon games, allowing them to have battles with the Pokémon on their Game Boy Games against computer-controlled or real-life opponents. They also contain several features for interacting with the Game Boy games, including the ability to play the Game Boy game using the TV and the ability to store and transfer Pokémon and items. Players that do not have a physical Game Boy game to connect with, or those playing the Switch Online releases, can still use rental Pokémon to compete in battles, and can also play minigames.</p>
      <p>The following games are part of the series:</p>
      <ul>
         <li><a href="Stadium-0/index.html">Pokémon Stadium 0</a>: This game, known as Pocket Monsters Stadium in Japan, was released only in Japan in 1998. Only 40 of the first 151 Pokémon are usable, and the game contains significantly fewer tournaments than its successor.</li>
         <li><a href="Stadium-1/index.html">Pokémon Stadium</a>: This game, known as Pocket Monsters Stadium 2 in Japan, was released in 1999 (Japan) and 2000 (international regions). All 151 Pokémon from Generation 1 are usable in this game, and the game contains many more tournaments with more varied rulesets than those used in Pokémon Stadium 0. The Japanese version of the game has a few major differences from the international version, including a few tournaments that were changed entirely and many changes to rental Pokémon's movesets.</li>
         <li>Pokémon Stadium 2: This game, known as Pocket Monsters Stadium G&S (Gold and Silver) in Japan, was released in 2000 (Japan) and 2001 (international regions). All 251 Pokémon from Generation 2 are usable in this game, and copies of Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow can still interact with it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although it does not have Stadium in the title, Pokémon Battle Revolution for the Wii was basically a Wii version of the Stadium concept. It was released in 2006 (Japan) and 2007 (international regions) and could connect wirelessly with the Nintendo DS and copies of Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, and SoulSilver.</p>
