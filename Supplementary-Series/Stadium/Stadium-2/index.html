      <h2>Pokémon Stadium 2</h2>
      <p>Pokémon Stadium 2 was released in 2000 (Japan) and 2001 (international) for the Nintendo 64. In Japanese, it is known as Pokémon Stadium G&S (Gold and Silver).</p>
      <p>In this game, the player can use Pokémon from their copies of Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, or Crystal to battle other human players or computer-controlled opponents. There are also rental Pokémon that the player can use, but their stats and movesets are usually inferior to those that could be created from a copy of one of the Game Boy games. It is, however, possible to complete the game's challenges using only rental Pokémon, although it does rely on luck.</p>
      <p>In addition to battling, the player can also interact with a connected copy of a Game Boy Pokémon game in a variety of ways. The player can:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Organize their boxes, party, and items on their Game Boy game, and transfer Pokémon and items back and forth between their Game Boy game and Stadium</li>
         <li>Trade Pokémon between two connected Game Boy games</li>
         <li>View their Pokémon's stats</li>
         <li>View their Pokédex with 3D models</li>
         <li>Transfer prize Pokémon awarded to the player in Stadium 2 to their Game Boy game</li>
         <li>Register a team of Pokémon for use in the battles</li>
         <li>Play the connected Game Boy game on the TV</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The game also features a handful of multiplayer minigames that can be played with up to four players.</p>
      <p>All 251 Pokémon available in Generations 1 and 2 (Bulbasaur through Celebi) can be used in this game, but not every species can be used in every cup. Details are given on the cups' pages.</p>
	  <p>In this game, unlocking Doduo Mode for Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow requires beating either Round 1 of all Stadium cups or Gym Leader Castle, and Dodrio Mode requires beating both. Doduo and Dodrio mode for Gold, Silver, and Crystal are unlocked the same way, but on Round 2.</p>
