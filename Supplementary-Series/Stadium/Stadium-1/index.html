      <h2>Pokémon Stadium</h2>
      <p>Pokémon Stadium was released in 1999 (Japan) and 2000 (international) for the Nintendo 64. Although this was the second Stadium game to be released in Japan, it was the first to be released in English-speaking regions, so it is typically called 'Stadium' or 'Stadium 1' by English-speaking fans.</p>
      <p>In this game, the player can use Pokémon from their copies of Red, Green, Blue, or Yellow to battle other human players or computer-controlled opponents. There are also rental Pokémon that the player can use, but their stats and movesets are usually inferior to those that could be created from a copy of one of the Game Boy games. It is, however, possible to complete the game's challenges using only rental Pokémon, although it does rely on luck.</p>
      <p>Beating a challenge registers the Pokémon used in the team to the Hall of Fame. Registering all 151 Pokémon to the Hall of Fame awards the player a Psyduck that knows Amnesia that can be traded to a copy of Red, Green, Blue, or Yellow.</p>
      <p>In addition to battling, the player can also interact with a connected copy of a Game Boy Pokémon game in a variety of ways. The player can:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Take pictures, which could be printed with a Sticker Station (only in North American releases)</li>
         <li>Organize their boxes, party, and items on their Game Boy game, and transfer Pokémon and items back and forth between their Game Boy game and Stadium</li>
         <li>Trade Pokémon between two connected Game Boy games</li>
         <li>View their Pokémon's stats</li>
         <li>View their Pokédex with 3D models</li>
         <li>Transfer prize Pokémon awarded to the player in Stadium to their Game Boy game</li>
         <li>Register a team of Pokémon for use in the battles</li>
         <li>Play the connected Game Boy game on the TV</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The game also features a handful of multiplayer minigames that can be played with up to four players.</p>
      <p>All 151 Pokémon available in Generation 1 (Bulbasaur through Mew) can be used in this game, but not every species can be used in every cup. Details are given on the cups' pages.</p>
