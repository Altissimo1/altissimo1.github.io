      <h2>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</h2>
      <p>Pokémon Legends: Arceus was released in 2022 for the Switch. While the game revolves around catching and battling Pokémon, the mechanics used to both catch and battle are vastly different from the core series games, and the game itself has more of an open-world element than most other Pokémon core series games. The game uses its own unique Pokédex, the Hisuian Pokédex, which consists primarily of Pokémon introduced in Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum. The Hisui Pokédex has a total of 242 Pokémon.</p>
