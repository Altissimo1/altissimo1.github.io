      <h2>Legends: Arceus Space-Time Distortions</h2>
      <h3><u>Overview</u></h3>
      <p>Space-time distortions first become active when the player first explores the Crimson Mirelands during Mission 8: Arezu's Predicament. At that time, they will be available in both the Obsidian Fieldlands and the Crimson Mirelands. Space-time distortions will also be available from the first time the player visits the Cobalt Coastlands, Coronet Highlands, and Alabaster Icelands.</p>
      <p>A space-time distortion is the name given to a phenomenon that can appear in any of the game's five wilderness areas. When a space-time distortion is active, the player will be able to encounter and catch wild Pokémon that are not native to the area; in some cases, some Pokémon can only ever be found in distortions. The distortion also contains several items, including Shards, high-value sellable items, and evolution items. Pokémon are often found at higher levels than most other Pokémon in the area, and alpha Pokémon in particular can reach levels in the 70s-80s. As several Pokémon are exclusive to distortions, understanding how and why distortions work is important for the goal of completing the Pokédex.</p>
      <h3><u>Mechanics</u></h3>
      <h4>Distortion Timer</h4>
      <p>After distortions have been unlocked, anytime the player enters a wilderness area from Jubilife Village, a timer is set, which I will refer to as the "distortion timer". This timer will be one of the following values: 5, 10, 15, 25, or 40 minutes. This represents the amount of time the player must spend in the overworld of that area (i.e. not in a battle) before the distortion will appear. Each timer option has a different chance of being selected by the game; these rates are shown in the table below.</p>

      <p>Because a distortion timer is <em>always</em> set when the player enters an area, it is guaranteed that the player will find a distortion by the time they have spent 40 minutes in the area. The table shown below, originally presented by <a href="https://x.com/Sibuna_Switch" target="_blank">Anubis</a> on <a href="https://x.com/Sibuna_Switch/status/1492311305990070272" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, presents the <em>cumulative</em> chance of encountering a distortion after spending a given amount of minutes in an area.</p>

      <p>During the part of the game between starting Mission 13: Disaster Looming and starting Mission 17: Atop Mount Coronet, when the player has been exiled from Jubilife Village and the sky is red, the rates of the 5-min and 10-minute distortions are switched: a 5-minute distortion has a 20% rate to appear, and a 10-minute distortion has a 10% rate. Because of this, and because this part of the game has no weather conditions, this part of the game is therefore a good place to search for many distortions, and is used for this in speedruns that involve catching all Pokémon.</p>
      <h4>Timer Interruptions</h4>
      <p>The timer will not tick down while the player is in a battle, menu, or dialogue box. However, weather conditions can still change and the time of day will still progress.</p>
      <p>Some things will interrupt and reset the distortion timer. Most of these are actions that the player can take - allowing the player to avoid the interruption by simply not doing those things - but one, weather conditions, cannot be controlled by the player (although it can be mitigated).</p>
      <p><strong>Leaving the wilderness area:</strong> Returning to Jubilife Village will stop the distortion timer for the exited area. When the player next enters an area, a new distortion timer will be generated. Exiting the area also removes existing distortions.</p>
      <p><strong>Closing the game:</strong> If the game is closed (the software is exited), then the next time the player turns on the game, a new distortion timer is generated. Closing the game also removes existing distortions.</p>
      <p><strong>Entering a sub-area:</strong> A sub-area is any area of the map where the player has to click 'A' to enter the area. This includes areas like Seaside Hollow, Wayward Cave, the cave leading to Spear Pillar, Snowpoint Temple, the Lake Guardians' caves, and Turnback Cave. A new distortion timer will be generated when the player exits the sub-area. Entering a sub-area also removes existing distortions.</p>
      <p><strong>Resting at camp to change the time:</strong> If the player selects any rest option <em>apart from</em> "rest for a short while", a new distortion timer will be generated when the player awakes. Resting to change the time also removes existing distortions.</p>
      <p><strong>Dying:</strong> Dying will cause a new distortion timer to be generated, and will also remove any existing distortions.</p>
      <p><strong>Bad weather:</strong> If, when the distortion timer reaches 0 minutes, the weather in the area is thunderstorm (<img src="../../../Resources/images/pla-icons/weather-icons/thunderstorm.png" width="25" alt="Thunderstorm">), drought (<img src="../../../Resources/images/pla-icons/weather-icons/drought.png" width="25" alt="Drought">), or snowstorm (<img src="../../../Resources/images/pla-icons/weather-icons/snowstorm.png" width="25" alt="Snowstorm">), the distortion will not spawn, and a new distortion timer will be generated. If one of these three weathers appears before the timer reaches 0 minutes, the distortion can still form so long as the weather has cleared by the time the timer reaches 0 minutes. In a battle, the distortion timer does not change, but weather can; therefore, the suggested method to mitigate this is to enter a battle as soon as you notice the weather has turned to one of these, and exit the battle after you notice the weather has changed. Additionally, the period of the game when the sky is red has no weather at all, preventing this from being a concern.</p>
      <h4>Distortion Formation</h4>
      <p>Once the distortion timer reaches 0 minutes, if the weather is favorable, a distortion will form on the map with the message "A space-time distortion seems to be forming!" Once this message appears, viewing the map will show a distortion icon in some part of the area. Distortion locations tend to be generally flat and free of water (that would require Basculegion to navigate). Once this message appears, a new timer will begin that reflects the amount of time until the distortion finishes forming. This timer can be seen on the map as a ring of desaturated color appearing around the distortion icon in a clockwise direction. The amount of time between the appearance of a distortion and its proper formation is dependent on the player's distance from the distortion when the distortion first appears, to allow the player ample time to make their way to the distortion. If the player is near or even in the area of the distortion, it will form quickly (a minimum of 60 seconds); the further away the player is, the longer the distortion takes to form. The rough formula that can be used to approximate the time is (distance/2 + 60) seconds. For 'distance', think of the entire map as being a 1024x1024 grid, and your distance is the amount of grid squares away from the distortion you are.</p>
      <p>The distortion's full formation will be preceded by a short period of a low rumbling noise. When the distortion appears, a message stating "A space-time distortion appeared!" is displayed. All Pokémon within the distortion's area, and in a short distance outside the area, are despawned. The distortion will last 4 minutes; during that time, only distortion Pokémon (whose mechanics are discussed below) will appear, and 30 rare items will be generated across the area of the distortion. The end of the distortion is marked with a similar low rumbling as that which preceded its formation, and the Pokémon that were despawned at the beginning of the distortion will reappear. At that time, a new distortion timer will be generated.</p>
      <p>If the player leaves the immediate vicinity of the distortion after it has formed, all Pokémon in the distortion, including rare Pokémon, will be despawned. Rare Pokémon will not re-appear if the player returns to the distortion, and no further rare Pokémon will spawn. Additionally, if the player uses fast-travel after the "A space-time distortion appeared!" message has appeared, all existing rare Pokémon in the distortion will despawn, and no more rare Pokémon will spawn. The player does not have to have seen the Pokémon spawn in order for them to be potentially affected by this: simply being within a short distance of the distortion boundary is sufficient.</p>
      <h3><u>Pokémon</u></h3>
      <p>There are two categories of Pokémon that can appear in a space-time distortion: common Pokémon and rare Pokémon. Once the distortion starts, every 20 seconds, the game will spawn between 2-3 common Pokémon while despawning any existing common Pokémon already in the distortion. All of these Pokémon will be aggressive toward the player, and engaging one of them in battle usually results in engaging all of them because of their physical proximity to each other and the difficulty of isolating one of them in only twenty seconds. If the player is able to start a battle with one of them, the 20-second timer will pause for the duration of the battle, giving the player ample opportunity to catch it.</p>
      <p>When a distortion begins, three designated spots are designated to be spawn locations for rare Pokémon. When the player gets close to a rare Pokémon spawn point, a Pokémon from the rare Pokémon table will be spawned. Unlike common spawns, rare Pokémon will remain present until they are captured, defeated, or the distortion ends. There will only ever be three rare spawns per distortion. Some rare spawns are only available once the player has seen the game's credits.</p>
      <h4>Levels</h4>
      <p>The levels of distortion Pokémon are partially dependent on how much progress the player has made through the main story. Every Pokémon that can appear in the distortion has a level range associated with it, as well as a level range associated with it for if it is an Alpha Pokémon. Reaching specific story checkpoints will cause the level ranges of all distortion Pokémon across all areas to increase by a set amount, depending on the area.
         <br>For example, if a Pokémon's level range is 30-33, and the player reaches a story checkpoint that increases levels by 10, that Pokémon will now appear in the level range 40-43 and can no longer be captured at lower levels. Therefore, if you intend to get a low-leveled Pokémon from a distortion, you must try to encounter it before reaching the checkpoint that will raise its levels.
      </p>
      <p>The tables below show the base levels for every distortion Pokémon. The checkpoints that increase levels, and the levels they are increased by, are as follows:</p>

      <h3><u>Items</u></h3>
      <p>When a distortion appears, 30 items will appear on the ground around the distortion. These items include the majority of evolution items (except for Peat Block and Black Augurite), and valuable items that can be sold for money. They are colored with a sort of neon teal glow to set them apart from regular ground items in the area and make them visible against the dark backdrop of the distortion. The rates of any given item being a specific item are shown in the table below, adapted from <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQITz0sjoi20x6n6MBO4m7XB4vCiQ0862Q4ELiwoDP-KKIZ52c22bqHOfCfWou4KYgAhzKm1cKbgkRj/pubhtml" target="_blank">this</a> spreadsheet based on research by <a href="https://x.com/Sibuna_Switch" target="_blank">Anubis</a>.</p>
      <h4>Colored Shards</h4>
      <p>The Red Shard, Green Shard, and Blue Shard are by far the most common items to appear in a distortion. The chance of finding each color of shard depends on the area the distortion is in, as shown in the table below.</p>
