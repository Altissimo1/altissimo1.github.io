	  <h2>Legends Series</h2>
	  <p>The Legends series consists of the games Legends: Arceus and Legends: Z-A. These games take place in previously established Pokémon regions, but use very different mechanics from the main series Pokémon games, and their gameplay loops are very different from those of the main series.</p>
	  <p>Pokémon can be placed in the games via Pokémon HOME and placed from these games into HOME, making them compatible with main series games.</p>
      <p>The following games are part of the series:</p>
      <ul>
         <li><a href="Legends-Arceus/index.html">Legends: Arceus</a>: This was released in January 2022 for the Nintendo Switch. A total of 242 Pokémon are available in this game.</li>
