      <p>A list of only Shadow Pokémon and their levels, held items, and moves can be found <a href="shadow-pokemon.html">here</a>.</p>
	  <p>Most Shadow Pokémon cannot be Snagged from their original Trainer after the first battle, if the player failed to Snag them at that time. In those cases, the player will have to use the Miror Radar to find Miror B. at <a href="../Locations/pyrite-colosseum.html?xd">Pyrite Colosseum</a>, a <a href="../Locations/poke-spots.html?xd">Poké Spot</a>, or <a href="../Locations/realgam-colosseum.html?xd">Realgam Colosseum</a>, and he will have an un-Snagged Shadow Pokémon when battled.</p>
