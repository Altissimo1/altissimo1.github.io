      <h2>Orre Duo (Colosseum & XD: Gale of Darkness)</h2>
      <p>The two Orre games are a duo of console games released for the GameCube between 2003 and 2005, both set in the Orre region. In a sense, these games follow a similar pattern to the Pokémon Stadium games, because of their heavy emphasis on battling and their ability to connect to handheld Pokémon games. However, they differ from Stadium in that both games contain a story mode, where the player can collect a small selection of Pokémon to use for the battle challenges, instead of the player being forced to use rental Pokémon or Pokémon from the handheld games.</p>
	  <p>These games can connect to the player's Game Boy Advance Pokémon games, allowing them to have battles with the Pokémon on their Game Boy Advance games against computer-controlled or real-life opponents. The Pokémon obtained in both games' Story Modes can be traded to a Game Boy Advance game.</p>
      <p>The following games are part of the series:</p>
      <ul>
         <li><a href="Colosseum/index.html">Colosseum</a>: This game was released in 2003 in Japan and 2004 internationally. The player can obtain 52 Pokémon (not counting the evolutions of some of these), with a handful of others having been obtainable via the Bonus Disc (given away with pre-ordered copies) and some e-Reader events. In Generation 3, this game was the only way to obtain a Ho-Oh without attending a Nintendo event.</li>
         <li><a href="XD/index.html">XD: Gale of Darkness</a>: This game was released in 2005. The player can obtain 100 Pokémon (not counting the evolutions of some of these). In Generation 3, this game was the only way to obtain a Lugia without attending a Nintendo event.</li>
      </ul>
