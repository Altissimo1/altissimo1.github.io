    <h4><a href="https://altissimo1.github.io/">Home</a></h4>
    <p>A list of off-site resources for various & sundry Pokémon things.</p>
    
    <h3>Main Series</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.pokebip.com/">PokéBip</a>: Looks to have some of the most accurate encounter table and general location information for most areas in Pokémon. Only problem - it's in French. Which is why I intend to create my own area info, but their layout is definitely superior. <br /> 
      <a href="https://www.dragonflycave.com/calculators">The Cave of Dragonflies calculators</a>: Capture calculators for all gens. <br />
      <a href="https://www.dragonflycave.com/mechanics">The Cave of Dragonflies mechanics</a>: General research into many mechanical aspects of the games, including Gen 4 honey trees, Gen 1 stats, and Gen 1 Safari Zone. <br />
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1afu8l1-NAAoaqPLQj5pRCisGkiAhI3gYs-aDZJ_Dj8Q/edit#gid=0">Inundata Sheets</a>: A compilation of sheets that includes some Battle facility info for Crystal, Gen 5, Gen 6, Gen 7, and Gen 8, and data on Gen 3 and 4 Contests and the Contest properties of moves. <br />
      <a href="https://www.smogon.com/forums/forums/battle-facilities.697/">Smogon Battle Facility Threads</a>: All games with a Battle Facility have a thread here, and every original post (or one close after it) contains links to resources specific to that Facility. <br />
      <a href="https://ranger.maybreak.com/arceus/research">Pokémon Legends: Arceus Pokédex Checklist</a> <br />
      <a href="https://altissimo1.github.io/">Pokémon Legends: Arceus Maps</a>: Found on this site. <br />
      <a href="http://tshadowknight.com/Headbutt%20Grid.htm">Gen 2 Headbutt Trees Calculator</a> <br />
      <a href="https://i-made-a-website/pokemon_gen3/pokedex_tracker">Gen 3 specific Pokédex completion site<br />
      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProfessorOak/comments/qzgz4b/rprofessoroak_guide_master_thread_resources/">Professor Oak Challenge Guides</a>: The Professor Oak challenge involves catching and evolving every available Pokémon before moving to a new Gym. Even if you don't want to play the challenge, the guides contain some of the most accurate information on getting as many Pokémon as possible without trading that there is. I plan to write my own pages about "single-player Pokédexes" at some point as well.<br />
      <a href="https://www.smogon.com/ingame/">Smogon In-game Resources</a>: A plethora of in-game guides, including RNG manipulation for Gens 3-7, Shiny Hunting guides, item locations, Tips and Tricks, breeding mechanics, EV mechanics, and more.</a>

    <h3>Know of a resource not listed? Know of a better resource for something already posted on here?</h3>
    <p>Contact me on Github (altissimo1) or Discord (Altissimo [hash] 7178). I'm amenable to throwing up any guides, tables, maps, etc. that you have and want to host, too, so long as you're OK with the minimalist design of the site.</p>
